"Convolutional Neural Networks in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Deep Learning in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow",52,3.62,13,1,"This is the 3rd part in my Data Science and Machine Learning series on Deep Learning in Python. At this point, you already know a lot about neural networks and deep learning, including not just the basics like backpropagation, but how to improve it using modern techniques like momentum and adaptive learning rates. You've already written deep neural networks in Theano and TensorFlow, and you know how to run code using the GPU.  This book is all about how to use deep learning for computer vision using convolutional neural networks. These are the state of the art when it comes to image classification and they beat vanilla deep networks at tasks like MNIST.  In this course we are going to up the ante and look at the StreetView House Number (SVHN) dataset - which uses larger color images at various angles - so things are going to get tougher both computationally and in terms of the difficulty of the classification task. But we will show that convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, are capable of handling the challenge!  Because convolution is such a central part of this type of neural network, we are going to go in-depth on this topic. It has more applications than you might imagine, such as modeling artificial organs like the pancreas and the heart. I'm going to show you how to build convolutional filters that can be applied to audio, like the echo effect, and I'm going to show you how to build filters for image effects, like the Gaussian blur and edge detection.  After describing the architecture of a convolutional neural network, we will jump straight into code, and I will show you how to extend the deep neural networks we built last time with just a few new functions to turn them into CNNs. We will then test their performance and show how convolutional neural networks written in both Theano and TensorFlow can outperform the accuracy of a plain neural network on the StreetView House Number dataset.  All the materials used in this book are FREE. You can download and install Python, Numpy, Scipy, Theano, and TensorFlow with pip or easy_install.  Lastly, my goal is to show you that convolutional networks arenÃ¢â¬â¢t magical and they donÃ¢â¬â¢t require expert-level math to figure out.  ItÃ¢â¬â¢s just the same thing we had with regular neural networks:  y = softmax( relu(X.dot(W1).dot(W2) )  Except we replace the first Ã¢â¬Ådot productÃ¢â¬Â with a convolution:  y = softmax( relu(conv(X, W1)).dot(W2) )  The way they are trained is exactly the same as before, so all your skills with backpropagation, etc. carry over.",4,2,5,2,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30238998-convolutional-neural-networks-in-python?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=970,Lazy Programmer (Goodreads Author),,"Genres, Nonfiction, Science, Technology, Business, Reference, Programming, Academic",2016-05-15,Kindle Edition,,Kindle Unlimited

Data Science for Immunologists,159,4.75,4,1,"Data science is a complex subject, but nevertheless one that can be made accessible to all through clear, intuitive explanations and worked examples.Existing software that forms the backbone of an immunologist's analytical toolkit (such as FlowJo and Prism) are expensive, inflexible and promotes a narrow mindset when it comes to analysing your data. On the other hand, the Python and R programming languages are open source, free and entirely customisable, giving the user the ability to implement any analysis they wish.Ã¢â¬â¹Although programming languages can seem daunting to the uninitiated, it's far easier to learn than many immunologists may think. Rather than seeking to become an expert programmer, an understanding of the main concepts is more than enough to conduct your own bespoke analyses when coupled with a sound mathematical and statistical understanding.Ã¢â¬â¹Our new book focusses on the practical aspects of data science, providing sufficient theoretical background without delving into all of the details of each of the methods presented.

"Managing Your Data Science Projects: Learn Salesmanship, Presentation, and Maintenance of Completed Models",156,3.29,7,1,"At first glance, the skills required to work in the data science field appear to be self-explanatory. Do not be fooled. Impactful data science demands an interdisciplinary knowledge of business philosophy, project management, salesmanship, presentation, and more. In Managing Your Data Science Projects , author Robert de Graaf explores important concepts that are frequently overlooked in much of the instructional literature that is available to data scientists new to the field. If your completed models are to be used and maintained most effectively, you must be able to present and sell them within your organization in a compelling way.The value of data science within an organization cannot be overstated. Thus, it is vital that strategies and communication between teams are dexterously managed. Three main ways that data science strategy is used in a company is to research its customers, assess risk analytics, and log operational measurements. These all require different managerial instincts, backgrounds, and experiences, and de Graaf cogently breaks down the unique reasons behind each. They must align seamlessly to eventually be adopted as dynamic models.Data science is a relatively new discipline, and as such, internal processes for it are not as well-developed within an operational business as others. With Managing Your Data Science Projects , you will learn how to create products that solve important problems for your customers and ensure that the initial success is sustained throughout the productÃ¢â¬â¢s intended life. Your users will trust you and your models, and most importantly, you will be a more well-rounded and effectual data scientist throughout your career.Who This Book Is ForEarly-career data scientists, managers of data scientists, and those interested in entering the field of data science",1,2,2,2,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45007557-managing-your-data-science-projects?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1006,Robert de Graaf,,"Genres, Reference, Programming, Nonfiction, Technology, Technical, Coding, Computers ...more",2019-06-08,Paperback,23.74,Purchase on Goodreads

"Unsupervised Machine Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Cluster Analysis, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Principal Components Analysis",57,3.62,13,1,"In a real-world environment, you can imagine that a robot or an artificial intelligence wonÃ¢â¬â¢t always have access to the optimal answer, or maybe there isnÃ¢â¬â¢t an optimal correct answer. YouÃ¢â¬â¢d want that robot to be able to explore the world on its own, and learn things just by looking for patterns.  Think about the large amounts of data being collected today, by the likes of the NSA, Google, and other organizations. No human could possibly sift through all that data manually. It was reported recently in the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal that the National Security Agency collects so much surveillance data, it is no longer effective.  Could automated pattern discovery solve this problem?  Do you ever wonder how we get the data that we use in our supervised machine learning algorithms?  Kaggle always seems to provide us with a nice CSV, complete with Xs and corresponding Ys.  If you havenÃ¢â¬â¢t been involved in acquiring data yourself, you might not have thought about this, but someone has to make this data!  A lot of the time this involves manual labor. Sometimes, you donÃ¢â¬â¢t have access to the correct information or it is infeasible or costly to acquire.  You still want to have some idea of the structure of the data.  This is where unsupervised machine learning comes into play.  In this book we are first going to talk about clustering. This is where instead of training on labels, we try to create our own labels. WeÃ¢â¬â¢ll do this by grouping together data that looks alike.  The 2 methods of clustering weÃ¢â¬â¢ll talk about: k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.  Next, because in machine learning we like to talk about probability distributions, weÃ¢â¬â¢ll go into Gaussian mixture models and kernel density estimation, where we talk about how to learn the probability distribution of a set of data.  One interesting fact is that under certain conditions, Gaussian mixture models and k-means clustering are exactly the same! WeÃ¢â¬â¢ll prove how this is the case.  Lastly, weÃ¢â¬â¢ll look at the theory behind principal components analysis or PCA. PCA has many useful applications: visualization, dimensionality reduction, denoising, and de-correlation. You will see how it allows us to take a different perspective on latent variables, which first appear when we talk about k-means clustering and GMMs.  All the algorithms weÃ¢â¬â¢ll talk about in this course are staples in machine learning and data science, so if you want to know how to automatically find patterns in your data with data mining and pattern extraction, without needing someone to put in manual work to label that data, then this book is for you.  All of the materials required to follow along in this book are free: You just need to able to download and install Python, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, and Sci-kit Learn.",3,5,3,1,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30333785-unsupervised-machine-learning-in-python?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1443,Lazy Programmer (Goodreads Author),,Not Found,2016-05-22,Kindle Edition,,Kindle Unlimited
What Is Data Science?,23,3.69,592,1,"We've all heard it: according to Hal Varian, statistics is the next sexy job. Five years ago, in What is Web 2.0, Tim O'Reilly said that ""data is the next Intel Inside."" But what does that statement mean? Why do we suddenly care about statistics and about data? This report examines the many sides of data science -- the technologies, the companies and the unique skill sets.The web is full of ""data-driven apps."" Almost any e-commerce application is a data-driven application. There's a database behind a web front end, and middleware that talks to a number of other databases and data services (credit card processing companies, banks, and so on). But merely using data isn't really what we mean by ""data science."" A data application acquires its value from the data itself, and creates more data as a result.

Hierarchical Linear Models: Applications and Data Analysis Methods,512,4.0,67,1,"
  ""This is a first-class book dealing with one of the most important areas of current research in applied statistics...the methods described are widely applicable...the standard of exposition is extremely high."" --Short Book Reviews from the International Statistical Institute
  

  ""The new chapters (10-14) improve an already excellent resource for research and instruction. Their content expands the coverage of the book to include models for discrete level-1 outcomes, non-nested level-2 units, incomplete data, and measurement error---all vital topics in contemporary social statistics. In the tradition of the first edition, they are clearly written and make good use of interesting substantive examples to illustrate the methods. Advanced graduate students and social researchers will find the expanded edition immediately useful and pertinent to their research."" --TED GERBER, Sociology, University of Arizona
  

  ""Chapter 11 was also exciting reading and shows the versatility of the mixed model with the EM algorithm. There was a new revelation on practically every page. I found the exposition to be extremely clear. It was like being led from one treasure room to another, and all of the gems are inherently useful. These are problems that researchers face everyday, and this chapter gives us an excellent alternative to how we have traditionally handled these problems.""--PAUL SWANK, Houston School of Nursing, University of Texas, Houston
  

  Popular in the First Edition for its rich, illustrative examples and lucid explanations of the theory and use of hierarchical linear models (HLM), the book has been reorganized intofour parts with four completely new chapters. The first two parts, Part I on ""The Logic of Hierarchical Linear Modeling"" and Part II on ""Basic Applications"" closely parallel the first nine chapters of the previous edition with significant expansions and technical clarifications, such as: 
  

  * An intuitive introductory summary of the basic procedures for estimation and inference used with HLM models that only requires a minimal level of mathematical sophistication in Chapter 3* New section on multivariate growth models in Chapter 6 * A discussion of research synthesis or meta-analysis applications in Chapter 7* Data analytic advice on centering of level-1 predictors and new material on plausible value intervals and robust standard estimators
  

  While the first edition confined its attention to continuously distributed outcomes at level 1, this second edition now includes coverage of an array of outcomes types in Part III:
  

  * New Chapter 10 considers applications of hierarchical models in the case of binary outcomes, counted data, ordered categories, and multinomial outcomes using detailed examples to illustrate each case * New Chapter 11 on latent variable models, including estimating regressions from missing data, estimating regressions when predictors are measured with error, and embedding item response models within the framework of the HLM model * New introduction to the logic of Bayesian inference with applications to hierarchical data (Chapter 13)
  

  The authors conclude in Part IV with the statistical theory and computations used throughout the book, including univariate models with normal level-1 errors, multivariate linear models, and hierarchical generalized linear models.

Big Data and Data Science Initiative in India - Upcoming Job Opportunities (Vol,548,0.0,0,1,"The first volume of the book entitled 'Big Data and Data Science Initiative in India-Upcoming Job Opportunities’ was published in July 2016.Since then a lot of events have taken place India like Demonetisation, Cashless economy, GST bill etc. besides smart city project, make in India, digital healthcare and New India Vision. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the demonetisation announcement on the night of 8 November, it started an administrative chain reaction focused on squeezing money launderers, promoting less-cash economy and of course remonetising the banking system. The CAG’s Centre for Data Management and Analytics (CDMA) is going to play a catalytic role to synthesise and integrate relevant data into auditing process. FIU and the RBI will be saddled with heaps of complex transaction data from the post-demonetisation months. Indian financial system is also generating huge data with several players’ foreign banks, public sector banks, private banks, cooperative banks, rural banks, credit cooperatives, and the specialized non-banking financial corporations. Presently the Income Tax department of GOI, will reportedly use big data analytics to comb through personal bank deposits money holders. As per reports, the analytics tool was used in the past for corporate tax reporting.

Increasing Seismic Safety by Combining Engineering Technologies and Seismological Data. NATO Science for Peace and Security Series.,382,0.0,0,1,"Too often the Earth's surface acted as a divide between seismologists and engineers. Now it is becoming clear that the building behaviour largely depends on the seismic input and the buildings on their turn act as seismic sources, in an intricate interplay that non-linear phenomena make even more complex. These phenomena are often the cause of observed damage enhancement during past earthquakes. While research may pursue complex models to fully understand soil dynamics under seismic loading, we need also simple models valid on average, whose results can be easily transferred to end users.Under the title Increasing Seismic Safety by Combining Engineering Technologies and Seismological Data, we grouped several topics to be discussed together by engineers and seismologists: Can we use ambient noise building and soil characterisation to extract useful information for engineers? How we can tell apart a frequency decrease due to distributed damage, concentrated damage, time- varying building and soil behaviour? Which is the role of transients in ambient noise analysis? Can we quantify the influence of existing buildings on ground-motion recordings? To which extent soil-building resonance is a cause of damage enhancement? How to couple soil and building non-linear behaviour? On most questions there is an unanimous answer, but in some cases different views are present and the disagreement is faithfully reported.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16892996-increasing-seismic-safety-by-combining-engineering-technologies-and-seis?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=826,Marco Mucciarelli ," Marijan Herak , John Cassidy ",Not Found,,ebbok,,Purchase on Amazon

Data Science and Business Intelligence: Advice from important Data Scientists around the World,,5.0,1,1,"A professional, no matter what area he belongs to, I believe, should never think that his truth is definitive or that his way of doing or solving something is the best.And, logically, I had to get it right and wrong to reach this simple conclusion.Now, what does that have to do with the purpose of this book? This book that I have gathered important tips and advice from an elite of data science professionals from various sectors and reputable experience?After I've worked on hundreds of consulting projects and implementation of best practices in Relationship Marketing (CRM), Business Intelligence (BI) and Customer Experience (CX), as well as countless Information Technology projects, one truth is absolute: We need data!Most companies say they do everything perfectly, but it is not shown in the media or the press the headache that the areas of Information Technology suffer to join the right data. And when they do manage to unite and make it available, the time to market has already been lost and possible opportunities.Therefore, if a company wants to be considered excellence in corporate governance and satisfy the legal, marketing, sales, customer service, technology, logistics, products, among other areas, this company must start as soon as possible to become a data-driven and real-time company.For this, I recommend companies look for their digital intuitions and digital inspirations.So, with this book, I am proposing that all the employees and companies will arrive one day that they will know how to use, from their data, their sixth sense. The sixth sense is an extrasensory perception, which goes beyond our five basic senses, vision, hearing, taste, smell, touch. It is a sensation of intuition, which is a certain way allows us to have sensations of ""clairvoyance"" and even visions of future events. A company will only achieve this ability if it immediately begins to apply true data governance. And the illustrious data scientists who are part of this book will show you the way to take the first step:- Eric Siegel, Predictive Analytics World, USA- Bill Inmon, The Father of Datawarehouse, Forest Rim Technology, USA - Bram Nauts, ABN AMRO Bank, Netherlands- Jim Sterne, Digital Analytics Association, USA- Terry Miller, Siemens, USA- Shivanku Misra, Hilton Hotels, USA- Caner Canak, Turkcell, Turkey- Dr. Kirk Borne, Booz Allen Hamilton, USA - Dr. BÃÂ¼lent KÃÂ±zÃÂ±ltan, Harvard University, USA - Kate Strachnyi, Story by Data, USA- Kristen Kehrer, Data Moves Me, USA- Marie Wallace, IBM Watson Health, Ireland- Timothy Kooi, DHL, Singapore- Jesse Anderson, Big Data Institute, USA- Charles Givre, JPMorgan Chase & Co, USA- Anne Buff, Centene Corporation, USA- Bala Venkatesh, AIBOTS, Malaysia- Mauro Damo, Hitachi Vantara, USA- Dr. Rajkumar Bondugula, Equifax, USA- Waldinei Guimaraes, Experian, Brazil- Michael Ferrari, Atlas Research Innovations, USA- Dr. Aviv Gruber, Tel-Aviv University, Israel- Amit Agarwal, NVIDIA, IndiaThis book is part of the CRM and Customer Experience Trilogy called CX Trilogy which aims to unite the worldwide community of CX, Customer Service, Data Science, and CRM professionals.

The Data Science Design Manual,445,4.48,56,1,"This book serves an introduction to data science, focusing on the skills and principles needed to build systems for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. As a discipline, data science sits at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and machine learning, but it is building a distinct heft and character of its own.In particular, the book stresses the following basic principles as fundamental to becoming a good data scientist: ""Valuing Doing the Simple Things Right,"" laying the groundwork of what really matters in analyzing data; ""Developing Mathematical Intuition,"" so that readers can understand on an intuitive level why these concepts were developed, how they are useful and when they work best, and; ""Thinking Like a Computer Scientist, but Acting Like a Statistician,"" following approaches which come most naturally to computer scientists while maintaining the core values of statistical reasoning. The book does not emphasize any particular language or suite of data analysis tools, but instead provides a high-level discussion of important design principles.This book covers enough material for an ""Introduction to Data Science"" course at the undergraduate or early graduate student levels. A full set of lecture slides for teaching this course are available at an associated website, along with data resources for projects and assignments, and online video lectures.Other Pedagogical features of this book include: ""War Stories"" offering perspectives on how data science techniques apply in the real world; ""False Starts"" revealing the subtle reasons why certain approaches fail; ""Take-Home Lessons"" emphasizing the big-picture concepts to learn from each chapter; ""Homework Problems"" providing a wide range of exercises for self-study; ""Kaggle Challenges"" from the online platform Kaggle; examples taken from the data science television show ""The Quant Shop,"" and; concluding notes in each tutorial chapter pointing readers to primary sources and additional references.",35,13,8,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34266283-the-data-science-design-manual?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=214,Steven S.

"The Little Book of DATA SCIENCE, 2012 Edition",54,3.83,6,1,"NOTE: The publisher is continuing to make the 2012 edition of this book available for all those who might want it. However, we wish to let all potential buyers know that the new, updated 2013 edition of the work, re-titled A SIMPLE INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE, is now (as of November 6th, 2012) available from Amazon in both paper and Kindle editions.*********************** In THE LITTLE BOOK OF DATA SCIENCE, 2012 EDITION, Noreen Burlingame provides an elegant, concise, 15,000-word introduction to all aspects of the field. Burlingame addresses the various skills required, the key steps in the data science process, software technology related to the effective practice of data science, and the best rising academic programs for training in the field.To say the least, demand is high for ""data scientists"" - the rock stars of the rising generation in analytics: Big Data analytics. Ninety-seven percent of 2012 Master of Science in Analytics (MSA) graduates from North Carolina State's Institute for Advanced Analytics received one or more offers of employment before graduation, at an average base salary of $89,300. Vendors such as Cloudera, Hortonworks, MapR and others are commercializing Big Data software technologies, in effect making them easier to deploy and manage. The key challenge for organizations, therefore, is be to find the right talent to analyze the data. According to Forrester Research's James Kobielus: ""[Organizations will] have to ... hire statistical modelers, text mining professionals, people who specialize in sentiment analysis."" These people - who must also be skilled in developing adaptive software models, data cleaning and mining, and related tasks - are in short supply. By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 professionals with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions. This is all per a recent McKinsey and Company estimate.In a no-nonsense, concise, and elegantly-clear manner, Burlingame lays out the skills required, and all elements in the process of data science. Her book is the ideal introduction.CONTENTS - Introduction * Data Science in Brief * What is Big Data? * Hadoop * Data Management * Data Cleaning * Data Modeling for Unstructured Data * Predictive Analysis * Creativity and Intuition (or Posing the Right Question, at the Right Time, for the Right Data) * Data Visualization (or Telling the Story) * Cassandra, Solr and DataStax Enterprise * Vendors * Academic ProgramsABOUT THE AUTHORNoreen Burlingame is a leading IT consultant.

A Practitioner's Guide to Data Science,204,0.0,0,1,"Describing Data Science is like trying to describe the silence of the forest– it should be easy, but somehow capturing the words is impossible. Data Science is the art of turning data into actions. This is accomplished through the creation of data products, which provide actionable information without exposing decision makers to the underlying data or analytics (buy/sell strategies for financial instruments, a set of actions to improve product yield, or steps to improve product marketing). Data Science supports and encourages shifting between deductive (hypothesis-based) and inductive (pattern-based) reasoning. This is a fundamental change from traditional analytic approaches. Data Science creates an environment where models of reality no longer need to be static and empirically based. Instead, they are constantly tested, updated and improved until better models are found. While there are countless industry and academic publications describing what Data Science is and why we should care, little information is available to explain how to make use of data as a resource. This book has tried to explain it a little.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97109821-a-practitioner-s-guide-to-data-science?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=719,C.

"Advanced Scientific Computing in Basic with Applications in Chemistry, Biology and Pharmacology. Data Handling in Science and Technology, Volume 4.",,0.0,0,1,"This book gives a practical introduction to numerical methods and presents BASIC subroutines for real-life computations in the areas of chemistry, biology, and pharmacology. The choice of BASIC as the programming language is motivated by its simplicity, its availability on all personal computers and by its power in data acquisition. While most of the scientific packages currently available in BASIC date back to the period of limited memory and speed, the subroutines presented here can handle a broad range of realistic problems with the power and sophistication needed by professionals and with simple, step-by-step instructions for students and beginners.

Big Data Science & Analytics: A Hands-On Approach,544,4.29,7,1,"Data and information are fuel of this new age where powerful analytics algorithms burn this fuel to generate decisions that are expected to create a smarter and more efficient world for all of us to live in. This new area of technology has been defined as Big Data Science and Analytics, and the industrial and academic communities are realizing this as a competitive technology that can generate significant new wealth and opportunity. Big data is defined as collections of datasets whose volume, velocity or variety is so large that it is difficult to store, manage, process and analyze the data using traditional databases and data processing tools. Big data science and analytics deals with collection, storage, processing and analysis of massive-scale data. Industry surveys, by Gartner and e-Skills, for instance, predict that there will be over 2 million job openings for engineers and scientists trained in the area of data science and analytics alone, and that the job market is in this area is growing at a 150 percent year-over-year growth rate.We have written this textbook, as part of our expanding ""A Hands-On Approach""(TM) series, to meet this need at colleges and universities, and also for big data service providers who may be interested in offering a broader perspective of this emerging field to accompany their customer and developer training programs. The typical reader is expected to have completed a couple of courses in programming using traditional high-level languages at the college-level, and is either a senior or a beginning graduate student in one of the science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. An accompanying website for this book contains additional support for instruction and learning (www.big-data-analytics-book.com)The book is organized into three main parts, comprising a total of twelve chapters. Part I provides an introduction to big data, applications of big data, and big data science and analytics patterns and architectures. A novel data science and analytics application system design methodology is proposed and its realization through use of open-source big data frameworks is described. This methodology describes big data analytics applications as realization of the proposed Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta models, that comprise tools and frameworks for collecting and ingesting data from various sources into the big data analytics infrastructure, incorporating distributed filesystems and non-relational (NoSQL) databases for data storage, and processing frameworks for batch and real-time analytics.

In this highly digitized world today, everyone seems to have an urgent need to do something with all the Ã¢â¬ÅBig DataÃ¢â¬Â for fear of missing out on something. Businesses, from banks to car manufacturers, depend on data scientists to help them make important decisions that will bolster their bottom line and edge out the competition. Government agencies at all levels use their findings to make important policy changes. Even nonprofit organizations depend on data scientists to help them improve the lives of countless people.It is a challenging job to take an enormous pile of information and distill it into something useful. There is simply too much information for the average person to process and use. It is the data scientistÃ¢â¬â¢s mission to analyze data for actionable insights, but theirs is no easy task. Using a combination of math, statistics, and programming skills, data scientists are able to compile, organize, clean, and interpret any number of data points. They then use their expert analytic skills to uncover hidden solutions that can be applied to a wide range of purposes. It takes some rigorous education to become an effective data scientist. They need to become expert programmers, using tools like Python, SQL, R, and Scala. They need cutting-edge skills in machine learning, data visualization, artificial intelligence, modeling, and optimization. They have to be expert in using Excel. Most data science professionals have graduate degrees, either a masterÃ¢â¬â¢s or PhD, in data science, statistics, computer science, or mathematics. Data scientists come from a wide range of educational backgrounds, though some technical training is always necessary. For example, those educated in business or human behavior can offer unique perspectives that allow them to arrive at more accurate and relevant conclusions. There is a wide array of opportunities for professionals with the advanced skills and know-how to work in data science roles. The demand is high now Ã¢â¬â well above the national average Ã¢â¬â and the trend is zooming upward. Over the next few years, the analytics market is expected to grow by leaps and bounds until it is at least one-third of the global IT market. Organizations of all kinds are scrambling to integrate data science into their business processes. Although the demand is rising steadily, there is a huge deficit on the supply side of qualified employees, creating excellent prospects for future data scientists. Those in the field can look forward to a promising job market and longevity, and there is more good news as well. Data scientists enjoy excellent compensation for their work, with a median income of almost $100,000 and the potential to earn $250,000 a year.

Chemometrics in Food Chemistry: Chapter 6.

MCR provides the qualitative and quantitative contribution (profile) of each of the compounds in a sample from the sole information of the raw experimental data acquired. Food analysis is about knowing the qualitative and quantitative composition of foodstuffs and, hence, MCR fits very well in this scenario. Typical problems related to food analysis that can be solved by MCR are the identification and analytical determination of target compounds in the presence of unknown interferences/compounds, obtaining food fingerprint information to be used for authentication, adulteration or other purposes, and the interpretation of food processes. All these situations can be solved by handling measurements as simple as a data table with one spectrum (response) per sample or as complex as flexible multiset structures formed by several data tables (e.g. excitation/emission spectra, hyphenated separation high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection, liquid chromatography or gas chromatographyÃ¢â¬âmass spectrometry, etc.), each of them related to a sample or to a particular food condition.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101066274-chemometrics-in-food-chemistry?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1029,Anna de Juan,,Not Found,2013-06-08,Kindle Edition,25.99,Purchase on Goodreads

"Data Recovery - A Science of Trust and Ingenuity: Causes, Precautions, Tools, Strategies, Market Overview",96,0.0,0,1,"When you experience a malfunction of your PC, MacBook or other device, you do tend to be annoyed at this inconvenience. Even if you are a busy person, you need to pay attention to that device of yours. It is literally calling for help before it kicks the bucket. Of course, you might cry out loud not at me for expecting your company IT to fail or your much-loved smartphone to die on your lap.Unfortunately, most electronic devices suffer from wear, mal treatment and potential malice. In such situations it is vital to sit down and try to get calm thoughts. Going into irrational actions often cause greater damage than what just happened a few minutes ago to your device.Before I go into further details, I would like to briefly explain the objective of my book. I published my original book on data recovery in the German language in 2011 and continued to publish updated releases every 2-3 years. You might ask, why I bother doing this at all?Over the many years of having been helping people with their computer problems and where necessary recovering lost data, I have come to realize that there is a lot of fake information and misconceptions. Some of the negativity brought towards the real data recovery professionals comes from former experiences people have had with some rather questionable data recovery companies. As life is, I was not always from time of leaving school working in data recovery. When I was over 30, I needed a data recovery for my Raid Server I was using in my young IT company I had founded a year before. In my situation of not having access to the data of my business and other data I had stored there, I urgently looked for a way to get that data back.Let me now take you on an informative and hopefully also useful journey into the world of data recovery. I want you to avoid scams and treat your equipment with the necessary care they deserve from you.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138333497-data-recovery---a-science-of-trust-and-ingenuity?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1343,Christian Bartsch,,Not Found,2021-04-17,Kindle Edition,,Purchase on Amazon

Data Science and Data Analytics: Opportunities and Challenges,464,2.0,1,1,"Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured (labeled) and unstructured (unlabeled) data. It is the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a necessity of the future to make things easier and more productive. In simple terms, data science is the discovery of data or uncovering hidden patterns (such as complex behaviors, trends, and inferences) from data. Moreover, Big Data analytics/data analytics are the analysis mechanisms used in data science by data scientists. Several tools, such as Hadoop, R, etc., are used to analyze this large amount of data to predict valuable information and for decision-making. Note that structured data can be easily analyzed by efficient (available) business intelligence tools, while most of the data (80% of data by 2020) is in an unstructured form that requires advanced analytics tools. But while analyzing this data, we face several concerns, such as complexity, scalability, privacy leaks, and trust issues. Data science helps us to extract meaningful information or insights from unstructured or complex or large amounts of data (available or stored virtually in the cloud). Data Science and Data Opportunities and Challenges covers all possible areas, applications with arising serious concerns, and challenges in this emerging field in detail with a comparative analysis/taxonomy.

It also looks at the role and profile of the Data Scientist, in reference to functionality, academic background, and required skills. The result is a global overview of what Big Data is, and how this new form is leading the world towards a new way of social construction, consumption, and processes.   Data Mining and Machine Learning  Machine learning refers to the methods or algorithms that are used as an alternative to traditional statistical methods. When we apply these methods in the analysis of data, these are termed data mining. Recommender systems, collaborative filtering, association rules, optimization methods based on heuristics, as well as a myriad of methods for regression, classification, and clustering are all examples of machine learning. Machine learning, however, is data-adaptive: model specification is defined by applying algorithms to the data. With machine learning, a few assumptions are made about the underlying distributions of the data.

DATA SCIENCE CRASH COURSE: Drinking Water Potability Classification and Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python,243,0.0,0,1,"In this data science crash course project, we aim to build a classification and prediction model to determine the potability of drinking water using machine learning and deep learning techniques in Python.The first step of the project involves data exploration, where we examine the dataset's structure and characteristics. We identify the target variable, ""Potability,"" which indicates whether the water is safe to drink (1) or not (0). We check for any missing values and handle them appropriately to ensure the dataset's integrity.Next, we analyze the distribution of features in the dataset to understand their statistical properties. We visualize the feature distributions through histograms, box plots, and density plots. This exploration helps us identify potential outliers or skewed features that might require preprocessing.Before building the predictive models, we split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the machine learning models, while the testing set evaluates their performance on unseen data.To start with machine learning models, we employ algorithms Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting.. We use the Grid Search technique to optimize their hyperparameters, ensuring the best possible performance.After evaluating and selecting the best-performing machine learning model, we explore deep learning techniques using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ANN architecture consists of input, hidden, and output layers. We determine the optimal number of hidden layers and neurons through experimentation. To train the ANN, we use the training data and optimize the model's weights using backpropagation and gradient descent. We also employ techniques like dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting.After training the models, we evaluate its performance on the test set. To gauge the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, we generate a classification report. Additionally, we plot the training and validation accuracy as well as the loss during the training process to visualize the model's learning progress.For further insights, we plot a confusion matrix, which provides a comprehensive view of the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions. This helps us assess the model's performance in handling different classes.Throughout the project, we prioritize model evaluation to ensure reliable predictions. We compute the accuracy score, which gives us an overall understanding of the model's correctness.

The idea is to segment customers based on when their last purchase was, how often they've purchased in the past, and how much they've spent overall.Clustering, in this case K-Means algorithm, used in this project can be used to place similar customers into mutually exclusive groups; these groups are known as Ã¢â¬ÅsegmentsÃ¢â¬Â while the act of grouping is known as segmentation. Segmentation allows businesses to identify the different types and preferences of customers/markets they serve. This is crucial information to have to develop highly effective marketing, product, and business strategies.The dataset in this project has 38765 rows of the purchase orders of people from the grocery stores. These orders can be analyzed with RFM analysis and can be clustered using K-Means algorithm.The machine learning models used in this project to predict clusters as target variable are K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, LGBM, Gradient Boosting, XGB, and MLP.

Can we classify an entity based on given features if our data science model is trained on certain number of samples with similar features related to specific classes? Do the samples, in a given dataset, cluster in specific classes based on similar or correlated features? Can our machine learning model recognise and classify new inputs based on prior training on a sample of similar inputs? STAGE 2: Acquire. Search. Create. Catalog. This stage involves data acquisition strategies including searching for datasets on popular data sources or internally within your organisation. We may also create a dataset based on external or internal data sources. The acquire stage may feedback to the question stage, refining our problem and solution definition based on the constraints and characteristics of the acquired datasets. STAGE 3: Wrangle. Prepare. Cleanse. The data wrangle phase prepares and cleanses our datasets for our project goals. This workflow stage starts by importing a dataset, exploring the dataset for its features and available samples, preparing the dataset using appropriate data types and data structures, and optionally cleansing the data set for creating model training and solution testing samples. The wrangle stage may circle back to the acquire stage to identify complementary datasets to combine and complete the existing dataset. STAGE 4: Analyse. Patterns. Explore. The analyse phase explores the given datasets to determine patterns, correlations, classification, and nature of the dataset. This helps determine choice of model algorithms and strategies that may work best on the dataset. The analyse stage may also visualize the dataset to determine such patterns. STAGE 5: Model. Predict. Solve. The model stage uses prediction and solution algorithms to train on a given dataset and apply this training to solve for a given problem. STAGE 6: Visualize. Report. Present. The visualization stage can help data wrangling, analysis, and modeling stages. Data can be visualized using charts and plots suiting the characteristics of the dataset and the desired results. Visualization stage may also provide the inputs for the supply stage. STAGE 7: Supply. Products. Services. Once we are ready to monetize our data science solution or derive further return on investment from our projects, we need to think about distribution and data supply chain. This stage circles back to the acquisition stage. In fact we are acquiring data from someone else's data supply chain.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41006000-data-science-solutions?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1042,Manav Sehgal (Goodreads Author),,Not Found,2017-02-07,Paperback,4.5,Purchase on Goodreads

This techniques are very important for work in Data Science. In addition, the book also develops examples and applications relating to such methods. Nonparametric Techniques splits into two broad categories: classification and regression. - In classification, the goal is to assign a class (or label) from a finite set of classes to an observation. That is, responses are categorical variables. Applications include spam filters, advertisement recommendation systems, and image and speech recognition. Predicting whether a patient will have a heart attack within a year is a classification problem, and the possible classes are true and false. Classification algorithms usually apply to nominal response values. However, some algorithms can accommodate ordinal classes (see fitcecoc). - In regression, the goal is to predict a continuous measurement for an observation. That is, the responses variables are real numbers. Applications include forecasting stock prices, energy consumption, or disease incidence.

DATA SCIENCE with MATLAB. PREDICTIVE TECHNIQUES: REGRESSION,,0.0,0,1,"Data science includes a set of statistical techniques that allow extracting the knowledge immersed in the data automatically. One of the fundamental techniques in data science is the treatment of regression models. Regression is the process of fitting models to data. The models must have numerical responses. The regression process depends on the model. If a model is parametric, regression estimates the parameters from the data. If a model is linear in the parameters, estimation is based on methods from linear algebra that minimize the norm of a residual vector. If a model is nonlinear in the parameters, estimation is based on search methods from optimization that minimize the norm of a residual vector.The most important topics to be discussed in this book are the following:Ã¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅParametric Regression AnalysisÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅWhat Are Linear Regression Models?Ã¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅLinear RegressionÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅLinear Regression WorkflowÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅRegression Using Dataset ArraysÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅRegression Using TablesÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅLinear Regression with Interaction EffectsÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅInterpret Linear Regression ResultsÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅCookÃ¢â¬â¢s DistanceÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅCoefficient Standard Errors and Confidence IntervalsÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅCoefficient of Determination (R-Squared)Ã¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅDelete-1 StatisticsÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅDurbin-Watson TestÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅF-statistic and t-statisticÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅHat Matrix and LeverageÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅResidualsÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅSummary of Output and Diagnostic StatisticsÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅWilkinson NotationÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅStepwise RegressionÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅRobust Regression Ã¢â¬â Reduce Outlier EffectsÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅRidge RegressionÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅLasso and Elastic NetÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅWide Data via Lasso and Parallel ComputingÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅLasso RegularizationÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅLasso and Elastic Net with Cross ValidationÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅPartial Least SquaresÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅLinear Mixed-Effects ModelsÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅPrepare Data for Linear Mixed-Effects ModelsÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅRelationship Between Formula and Design MatricesÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅEstimating Parameters in Linear Mixed-Effects ModelsÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅLinear Mixed-Effects Model WorkflowÃ¢â¬ÂÃ¢â¬Â¢ Ã¢â¬ÅFit Mixed-Effects Spline RegressionÃ¢â¬Â",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52508076-data-science-with-matlab-predictive-techniques?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=618,A.

The kidneys filter waste and excess fluid from the blood. As kidneys fail, waste builds up. Symptoms develop slowly and aren't specific to the disease. Some people have no symptoms at all and are diagnosed by a lab test. Medication helps manage symptoms. In later stages, filtering the blood with a machine (dialysis) or a transplant may be requiredThe dataset used in this project was taken over a 2-month period in India with 25 features (eg, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, etc). The target is the 'classification', which is either 'ckd' or 'notckd' - ckd=chronic kidney disease. It contains measures of 24 features for 400 people. Quite a lot of features for just 400 samples. There are 14 categorical features, while 10 are numerical.

Designing and Building Data Science Solutions,111,0.0,0,1,"Data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) can have game-changing impacts for businesses, empowering them to increase operational efficiency, improve the quality of their services and understand their customers better. Yet for these benefits to be realised, data science initiatives must be designed and executed in a sensible way. Often these projects, while successful from a scientific standpoint, miss the mark in terms of business impact. Many business leaders are left feeling unsettled, balancing the need for innovation and the adoption of revolutionary technologies with an uncomfortable degree of uncertainty and risk of failure. For the data scientist the situation can be equally unnerving, with uncertainties about how to deliver a successful project when the path is not clear. Yet, these uncertainties and risks -- for the business leader and the data scientist alike -- can be controlled and managed if approached in a sensible manner. The authors have designed and delivered hundreds of projects across a wide range of industries. We have made many mistakes, and in the process we have learned what works well and where the common pitfalls lie. We wrote this book to share our experiences in hopes that it will help the reader -- whether a data science practitioner or a business leader -- reduce these risks and design projects that have the greatest chance of success. We share our approach to data science projects, addressing topics such as alignment to business imperatives, project design, project delivery and evaluation of success. Data science can be an exciting, invigorating field, and for the business leader, it can bring about revolutionary changes to an organisation that can come with huge returns on investment and value added. For the data scientist, designing and delivering successful projects is rewarding, stimulating and tremendously gratifying. We hope this guide gives you the confidence to understand the risks and approach your project in a sensible way.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86399116-designing-and-building-data-science-solutions?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=937,Jonathan Leslie, Neri Van Otten,,2020-10-16,Paperback,9.99,Purchase on Goodreads

Quantitative and qualitative assessment methods are described to implement and validate the solutions back in the real world where the problems originated.The ability to generate, gather and store volumes of data in the order of tera- and exo bytes daily has far outpaced our ability to derive useful information with available computational resources for many domains.This book focuses on data science and problem definition, data cleansing, feature selection and extraction, statistical, geometric, information-theoretic, biomolecular and machine learning methods for dimensionality reduction of big datasets and problem solving, as well as a comparative assessment of solutions in a real-world setting.This book targets professionals working within related fields with an undergraduate degree in any science area, particularly quantitative. Readers should be able to follow examples in this book that introduce each method or technique. These motivating examples are followed by precise definitions of the technical concepts required and presentation of the results in general situations.

Environmental Data Management,312,0.0,0,1,"The diverse nature of environmental problems mankind has encountered within the last decade has developed a new understanding of the nature of environmental processes. Currently, the environment is considered as a continuum of air, soil and water as the vital components for sustaining life on earth. The interactive nature of these components requires that the environment is managed and protected as a cohesive whole. This can only be accomplished through an integrated approach to environmental management. Besides the concept of environmental continuum, prospects for sustainable development of natural resources and the recent recognition of global climate change impacts have also necessitated such an integrated approach to environmental management. Two basic tools for integrated management of the environment are modeling and environmental data. Both tools were available and valid in the past; however, the recent requirements for integrated environmental management have also led to a significant evolution of both modeling procedures and data management systems.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13039407-environmental-data-management?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1460,Nilgun B.

Environmental Geoinformatics: Extreme Hydro-Climatic and Food Security Challenges: Exploiting the Big Data,,0.0,0,1,"This second edition includes updated chapters from the first edition as well as five additional new chapters (Light detection and ranging (LiDAR), CORONA historical de-classified products, Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs), GNSS-reflectometry and GNSS applications to climate variability), shifting the main focus from monitoring and management to extreme hydro-climatic and food security challenges and exploiting big data. Since the publication of first edition, much has changed in terms of technology, and the demand for geospatial data has increased with the advent of the big data era. For instance, the use of laser scanning has advanced so much that it is unavoidable in most environmental monitoring tasks, whereas unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs)/drones are emerging as efficient tools that address food security issues as well as many other contemporary challenges. Furthermore, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are now responding to challenges posed by climate change by unravelling the impacts of teleconnection (e.g., ENSO) as well as advancing the use of reflected signals (GNSS-reflectometry) to monitor, e.g., soil moisture variations. Indeed all these rely on the explosive use of Ã¢â¬Åbig dataÃ¢â¬Â in many fields of human endeavour.Moreover, with the ever-increasing global population, intense pressure is being exerted on the EarthÃ¢â¬â¢s resources, leading to significant changes in its land cover (e.g., deforestation), diminishing biodiversity and natural habitats, dwindling fresh water supplies, and changing weather and climatic patterns (e.g., global warming, changing sea level). Environmental monitoring techniques that provide information on these are under scrutiny from an increasingly environmentally conscious society that demands the efficient delivery of such information at a minimal cost. Environmental changes vary both spatially and temporally, thereby putting pressure on traditional methods of data acquisition, some of which are highly labour intensive, such as animal tracking for conservation purposes. With these challenges, conventional monitoring techniques, particularly those that record spatial changes call for more sophisticated approaches that deliver the necessary information at an affordable cost. One direction being pursued in the development of such techniques involves environmental geoinformatics, which can act as a stand-alone method or complement traditional methods.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85108182-environmental-geoinformatics?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=935,Joseph Awange, John Kiema,,2019-01-17,Hardcover,138.08,Purchase on Goodreads

Part II, Doing Statistics explains that much of statistical inference is about learning unknown quantities in the model (e.g. its parameters) from the data it is presumed to have generated. Part III, Facing Uncertainty explains the importance of explicitly describing how much uncertainty we have about the model parameters, especially those with intrinsic scientific meaning, and of taking that into account when making decisions.Essential Statistics for Data A Concise Crash Course provides an in-depth introduction for beginners, while being more serious than a typical undergraduate text, but still lighter and more accessible than an average graduate text.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112973887-essential-statistics-for-data-science?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=879,Mu Zhu,,,2023-07-04,Paperback,,Purchase on Amazon

Estimation of Dependences Based on Empirical Data,523,0.0,0,1,"Twenty-?ve years have passed since the publication of the Russian version of the book Estimation of Dependencies Based on Empirical Data (EDBED for short). Twen- ?ve years is a long period of time. During these years many things have happened. Looking back, one can see how rapidly life and technology have changed, and how slow and dif?cult it is to change the theoretical foundation of the technology and its philosophy. I pursued two goals writing this Afterword: to update the technical results presented in EDBED (the easy goal) and to describe a general picture of how the new ideas developed over these years (a much more dif?cult goal). The picture which I would like to present is a very personal (and therefore very biased) account of the development of one particular branch of science, Empirical - ference Science. Such accounts usually are not included in the content of technical publications. I have followed this rule in all of my previous books. But this time I would like to violate it for the following reasons. First of all, for me EDBED is the important milestone in the development of empirical inference theory and I would like to explain why. S- ond, during these years, there were a lot of discussions between supporters of the new 1 paradigm (now it is called the VC theory ) and the old one (classical statistics).",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2787447-estimation-of-dependences-based-on-empirical-data?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=410,Vladimir Vapnik, S.

This is particularly true when it comes to the regional level. This volume will help to improve the insight into the rich stock of European datasets which cover any kind of regional information. Many institutions ranging from statistical offices to more academic research centres and commercial enterprises report their offerings with special emphasis on the regional level (e.g. European Community Household Panel, European Social Survey, Labour Force Survey). Central categories as NUTS and LAU are explained and discussed. In addition, typical examples of socio-economic cross-border and multi-level studies highlight the power of a regionalized European perspective. Furthermore, information about special tools for such type of analysis is included in the volume.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10159431-europe-and-its-regions?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=873,Gerd GrÃÂ¶zinger, Wenzel Matiaske and C.

Geographic Data Science with R: Visualizing and Analyzing Environmental Change,284,0.0,0,1,"The burgeoning field of data science has provided a wealth of techniques for analysing large and complex geospatial datasets, including descriptive, explanatory, and predictive analytics. However, applying these methods is just one part of the overall process of geographic data science. Other critical steps include screening for suspect data values, handling missing data, harmonizing data from multiple sources, summarizing the data, and visualizing data and analysis results. Although there are many books available on statistical and machine learning methods, few encompass the broader topic of scientific workflows for geospatial data processing and analysis. The purpose of Geographic Data Science with R is to fill this gap by providing a series of tutorials aimed at teaching good practices for using geospatial data to address problems in environmental geography. It is based on the R language and environment, which currently provides the best option for working with diverse spatial and non-spatial data in a single platform. Fundamental techniques for processing and visualizing tabular, vector, and raster data are introduced through a series of practical examples followed by case studies that combine multiple types of data to address more complex problems. The book will have a broad audience. Both students and professionals can use it as a workbook to learn high-level techniques for geospatial data processing and analysis with R. It is also suitable as a textbook. Although not intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to R, it is designed to be accessible to readers who have at least some knowledge of coding but little to no experience with R.

"Indexing It All: The Subject in the Age of Documentation, Information, and Data",184,4.12,17,1,"A critical history of the modern tradition of documentation, tracing the representation of individuals and groups in the form of documents, information, and data.In this book, Ronald Day offers a critical history of the modern tradition of documentation. Focusing on the documentary index (understood as a mode of social positioning), and drawing on the work of the French documentalist Suzanne Briet, Day explores the understanding and uses of indexicality. He examines the transition as indexes went from being explicit professional structures that mediated users and documents to being implicit infrastructural devices used in everyday information and communication acts. Doing so, he also traces three epistemic eras in the representation of individuals and groups, first in the forms of documents, then information, then data.Day investigates five cases from the modern tradition of documentation. He considers the socio-technical instrumentalism of Paul Otlet, Ã¢â¬Åthe father of European documentationÃ¢â¬Â (contrasting it to the hermeneutic perspective of Martin Heidegger); the shift from documentation to information science and the accompanying transformation of persons and texts into users and information; social media's use of algorithms, further subsuming persons and texts; attempts to build android robotsÃ¢â¬âto embody human agency within an information system that resembles a human being; and social Ã¢â¬Åbig dataÃ¢â¬Â as a technique of neoliberal governance that employs indexing and analytics for purposes of surveillance. Finally, Day considers the status of critique and judgment at a time when people and their rights of judgment are increasingly mediated, displaced, and replaced by modern documentary techniques.",7,6,3,1,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22208011-indexing-it-all?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=287,Ronald E.

Since the last systematic review of these production cross sections in 1973 (LB I/5a, b, c) an impressive amount of new experimental data has been accumulated. In the first part of this volume almost 10000 data have been compiled for the production of radioisotopes by medium energetic protons on targets from He to Br. The precise values of the cross sections can be taken from the tables, whereas the figures show the general trend of the cross sections and can be more readily used for interpolations. In the second part of this volume the data for heavy targets and other projectiles will be compiled.

Introduction to HPC with MPI for Data Science,315,2.5,2,1,"This gentle introduction to High Performance Computing (HPC) for Data Science using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard has been designed as a first course for undergraduates on parallel programming on distributed memory models, and requires only basic programming notions. Divided into two parts the first part covers high performance computing using C++ with the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard followed by a second part providing high-performance data analytics on computer clusters. In the first part, the fundamental notions of blocking versus non-blocking point-to-point communications, global communications (like broadcast or scatter) and collaborative computations (reduce), with Amdalh and Gustafson speed-up laws are described before addressing parallel sorting and parallel linear algebra on computer clusters. The common ring, torus and hypercube topologies of clusters are then explained and global communication procedures on these topologies are studied. This first part closes with the MapReduce (MR) model of computation well-suited to processing big data using the MPI framework. In the second part, the book focuses on high-performance data analytics. Flat and hierarchical clustering algorithms are introduced for data exploration along with how to program these algorithms on computer clusters, followed by machine learning classification, and an introduction to graph analytics. This part closes with a concise introduction to data core-sets that let big data problems be amenable to tiny data problems. Exercises are included at the end of each chapter in order for students to practice the concepts learned, and a final section contains an overall exam which allows them to evaluate how well they have assimilated the material covered in the book.",0,1,0,0,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26784925-introduction-to-hpc-with-mpi-for-data-science?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=567,Frank Nielsen,,,,Paperback,39.49,Purchase on Goodreads

From the number of subscriptions they have on YouTube, to the number of Google Reviews they have read or written on a restaurant to the movies and shows they watch on Netflix based on recommendations off their predicted likes - all of these have a deep connection with data. Data is termed as the new oil thanks to its intrinsic value.This is why the most powerful companies on the planet like Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon owe their immense clout to the huge amount of data that they have accumulated about people and their behaviour. You have heard of the term Big Data which is all about gathering, storing, managing these multi-terabytes or more of data. Using this data to draw inferences about the past and more importantly making predictions about the future is Data Science.Data Science uses many next generation tools to handle Big Data and Python is one such tool that is very widely used today.

"Magnetic Properties of Metals: d-Elements, Alloys and Compounds",202,0.0,0,1,"During the last decades the knowledge of the magnetic properties of the d transition elements and of their metallic alloys and compounds has increased widely. The improvement of preparation techniques for well-defined substances, the development of sophisticated measuring methods and above all the drive to obtain more insight in the origin of magnetic interactions in solids have resulted in the publication of many specific magnetic properties for an abundance of all kinds of metallic materials. The data assembled in this booklet are selected from the comprehensive compilation of magnetic and related properties of metals in the Landolt-Bornstein New Series Group III subÃÂ­ volumes 19a, band c. It has been attempted to include preferentially those properties which are of a basic character and which therefore are most often needed by scientists active in the field of solid state magnetism. In the field of magnetism, there is a gradual transition from the use of cgs/emu units to SI units. It was, however, not intended to represent all data in the units of one system, regardless of how nice this would have been from a systematic point of view. Instead, mostly preference was given to the system of units that was originally used by the authors whose work is quoted. Thus cgs/ emu units occur most frequently. Of colirse the user of the tables and figures is helped in several ways to convert the data to the units which he is most familiar with, see, e. g.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3932189-magnetic-properties-of-metals?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=336,H.P.J.

"Making Data Talk: The Science and Practice of Translating Public Health Research and Surveillance Findings to Policy Makers, the Public, and the Press",256,3.75,8,1,"The demand for health information continues to increase, but the ability of health professionals to provide it clearly remains variable. The aim of this book is (1) to summarize and synthesize research on the selection and presentation of data pertinent to public health, and (2) to provide practical suggestions, based on this research summary and synthesis, on how scientists and other public health practitioners can better communicate data to the public, policy makers, and the press in typical real-world situations. Because communication is complex and no one approach works for all audiences, the authors emphasize how to communicate data ""better"" (and in some instances, contrast this with how to communicate data ""worse""), rather than attempting a cookbook approach. The book contains a wealth of case studies and other examples to illustrate major points, and actual situations whenever possible. Key principles and recommendations are summarized at the end of each chapter.  This book will stimulate interest among public health practitioners, scholars, and students to more seriously consider ways they can understand and improve communication about data and other types of scientific information with the public, policy makers, and the press. Improved data communication will increase the chances that evidence-based scientific findings can play a greater role in improving the public's health.",3,2,2,0,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1943719.Making_Data_Talk?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=870,David E.

Modelling and Machine Learning Methods for Bioinformatics and Data Science Applications,102,0.0,0,1,"Mathematical modeling is routinely used in physical and engineering sciences to help understand complex systems and optimize industrial processes. Mathematical modeling differs from Artificial Intelligence because it does not exclusively use the collected data to describe an industrial phenomenon or process, but it is based on fundamental laws of physics or engineering that lead to systems of equations able to represent all the variables that characterize the process. Conversely, Machine Learning methods require a large amount of data to find solutions, remaining detached from the problem that generated them and trying to infer the behavior of the object, material or process to be examined from observed samples. Mathematics allows us to formulate complex models with effectiveness and creativity, describing nature and physics. Together with the potential of Artificial Intelligence and data collection techniques, a new way of dealing with practical problems is possible. The insertion of the equations deriving from the physical world in the data-driven models can in fact greatly enrich the information content of the sampled data, allowing to simulate very complex phenomena, with drastically reduced calculation times. Combined approaches will constitute a breakthrough in cutting-edge applications, providing precise and reliable tools for the prediction of phenomena in biological macro/microsystems, for biotechnological applications and for medical diagnostics, particularly in the field of precision medicine.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95095811-modelling-and-machine-learning-methods-for-bioinformatics-and-data-scien?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=499,Monica Bianchini ,,,2022-01-12,Hardcover,,Purchase on Amazon

The report included four principal recommendations, the first three of which confirmed existing NCES strategies and 1.The technical panel recommended that all NCES analyses and publications be based on restricted databases produced by applying data swapping operations to original data as collected and edited.2.The technical panel also recommended that access to restricted databases be controlled under license from NCES.3.The panel recommended that NCES produce public databases whenever possible (by applying further appropriate statistical disclosure limitation techniques) and provide access to the public databases electronically by means of a data access system (DAS).4.Furthermore the panel recommended that NCES tailor the user interfaces of data access systems to user communities",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79341339-national-institute-of-statistical-sciences-data-confidentiality-technica?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1082,Alan Karr,,,2013-03-07,Paperback,,Purchase on Amazon

Nonresponse in Social Science Surveys: A Research Agenda,166,3.0,1,1,"For many household surveys in the United States, responses rates have been steadily declining for at least the past two decades. A similar decline in survey response can be observed in all wealthy countries. Efforts to raise response rates have used such strategies as monetary incentives or repeated attempts to contact sample members and obtain completed interviews, but these strategies increase the costs of surveys. This review addresses the core issues regarding survey nonresponse. It considers why response rates are declining and what that means for the accuracy of survey results. These trends are of particular concern for the social science community, which is heavily invested in obtaining information from household surveys. The evidence to date makes it apparent that current trends in nonresponse, if not arrested, threaten to undermine the potential of household surveys to elicit information that assists in understanding social and economic issues. The trends also threaten to weaken the validity of inferences drawn from estimates based on those surveys. High nonresponse rates create the potential or risk for bias in estimates and affect survey design, data collection, estimation, and analysis. The survey community is painfully aware of these trends and has responded aggressively to these threats. The interview modes employed by surveys in the public and private sectors have proliferated as new technologies and methods have emerged and matured. To the traditional trio of mail, telephone, and face-to-face surveys have been added interactive voice response (IVR), audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI), web surveys, and a number of hybrid methods. Similarly, a growing research agenda has emerged in the past decade or so focused on seeking solutions to various aspects of the problem of survey nonresponse; the potential solutions that have been considered range from better training and deployment of interviewers to more use of incentives, better use of the information collected in the data collection, and increased use of auxiliary information from other sources in survey design and data collection. Nonresponse in Social Science A Research Agenda also documents the increased use of information collected in the survey process in nonresponse adjustment.",0,0,1,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17866660-nonresponse-in-social-science-surveys?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=236,National Research Council," Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Committee on National Statistics",,,Paperback,33.99,Purchase on Goodreads

Optimizing the Display and Interpretation of Data,148,0.0,0,1,"""What information do these data reveal?"" ""Is the information correct?"" ""How can I make the best use of the information?"" The widespread use of computers and our reliance on the data generated by them have made these questions increasingly common and important. Computerized data may be in either digital or analog form and may be relevant to a wide range of applications that include medical monitoring and diagnosis, scientific research, engineering, quality control, seismology, meteorology, political and economic analysis and business and personal financial applications. The sources of the data may be databases that have been developed for specific purposes or may be of more general interest and include those that are accessible on the Internet. In addition, the data may represent either single or multiple parameters. Examining data in its initial form is often very laborious and also makes it possible to ""miss the forest for the trees"" by failing to notice patterns in the data that are not readily apparent. To address these problems, this monograph describes several accurate and efficient methods for displaying, reviewing and analyzing digital and analog data. The methods may be used either singly or in various combinations to maximize the value of the data to those for whom it is relevant. None of the methods requires special devices and each can be used on common platforms such as personal computers, tablets and smart phones. Also, each of the methods can be easily employed utilizing widely available off-the-shelf software. Using the methods does not require special expertise in computer science or technology, graphical design or statistical analysis. The usefulness and accuracy of all the described methods of data display, review and interpretation have been confirmed in multiple carefully performed studies using independent, objective endpoints. These studies and their results are described in the monograph. Because of their ease of use, accuracy and efficiency, the methods for displaying, reviewing and analyzing data described in this monograph can be highly useful to all who must work with computerized information and make decisions based upon it.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26700373-optimizing-the-display-and-interpretation-of-data?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1854,Robert Warner,,,,Paperback,39.95,Purchase on Goodreads

I browsed through numerous online videos and training materials but with little success. After I agreed to pay a reasonable amount, a training course from a well-known e-learning platform gave me introductory knowledge on Python script. Learning the basic Python commands is one thing, whereas applying them to real life problems is another. For many months, the question - Ã¢â¬ÅWhich Python commands are important in solving real-life problems?Ã¢â¬Â bothered me a lot. It took me several sleepless nights, and a frantic lookout for a concise list of Python commands from an ocean of online information. My hands-on experiences designing Machine Learning models, performing root cause analysis by statistical hypothesis, and providing consultation as a Data Scientist, helped me learn the most crucial Python commands.

Python for Data Science: Advanced and Effective Strategies of Using Python Data Science Theories,,0.0,0,1,"Years ago, when the concept of data science was first introduced, it only meant gathering statistical data and cleaning data sets. It was simply just the science of collecting and presenting data. Together with technology evolution, however, paired with the increasing number of information we now have and continuously acquire, data science means so much more. It has now grown into a field of study that includes data analytics, predictive science and analytics, data mining, business intelligence, and machine learning, to name a few. It has now broken free of its confined definition of merely collecting and distributing data, which are very broad concepts and probably why people do not appreciate it today. The set of skills and applications we currently associate with data science is not absolute. Data scientists are free to interpret and use data science to whatever definition and goal they have, making data science an evolutionary concept free for humanity to define. Business intelligence is the process of collecting, integrating, and analyzing data for managers and executive officers with the primary goal of using this data for business decisions. If you look at the definition, it is very similar to what data science does as well. It acquires information, processes it, analyzes it, and also presents the data to relevant people to make smart decisions. And maybe thatÃ¢â¬â¢s why the two terms are used intertwined with each other. Both of these concepts use and revolve around data and usersÃ¢â¬â¢ ability to maximize it. The best way to differentiate between them is simply to understand that, although data science can be used for business intelligence, the latter concept is solely for business. This includes developing business insights, organizing data but only extracting those that would be relevant for the growth of the business, and presenting the data in a manner where business executives and stakeholders can derive decisions from. Data Science, since it is the broader concept, acquires much larger data and uses comparatively more complex systems, algorithms, and predictive models. Interestingly, business intelligence uses past data and information from consumers, government statistics, and international trends to understand what is happening now. Data Science, however, uses the same set of information but primarily is concerned with future predictions and forecasts growth. Their outputs, although similar in goal, are presented in different ways. In business intelligence, the reports are mainly presented in the simplest way possible, like reports, graphs, and business statistics. Conversely, in data science, the data is presented using a data model. It uses machine learning to gain future insights accurately based on whatever information is fed into it. It does not only capture the trends and leave the interpretation to human capacity but also gives the insights that are based on factual data. This makes predicting not only easier but also increasingly accurate. What this guide intends to do is go in-depth on some of the more popular advanced data science theories using Python, as well as an overview of machine learning, algorithms, and an in-depth tutorial on using SciPy to optimize your data so, letÃ¢â¬â¢s dive in.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53511330-python-for-data-science?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1832,Ethan Williams,,,2020-04-13,Kindle Edition,,Kindle Unlimited

The latest beginner's guide with practical applications on Machine learning and Artificial intelligence.,,2.0,1,1,"Do you want to learn Data analysis and Deep learning with Python coding and programming?Are you interested in practical applications on Machine learning and Artificial intelligence.?If yes, then keep reading...Many companies spend a lot of time collecting data and trying to use them to learn more about their customers and learning how to gain a competitive edge over others. Just gathering the data is not going to be enough to make it happen. Instead, we need to be able to take that data, and that data is usually pretty messy and needs some work and analyze it so that we are better able to handle all that comes with it.Data has always been relevant, but today, because of the growth in the internet and other sources, there is an unprecedented amount of data to work through. In the past, companies were able to manually go through the data they had and maybe use a few business intelligence tools to learn more about the customer and to make smart decisions. But nowadays this is nearly impossible.Evolving technologies are going to enable some cost savings for us, and smarter storage spaces to help us store some of this critical data. However, currently, in almost any industry and company, there is a huge need for skilled and knowledgeable data scientists. They are some of the highest-paid IT professionals right now, mainly because they can provide such a good value for the companies they work for, and because there is such a shortage in these professionals.This book covers:What is Data Analysis?The Basics of the Python LanguageUsing PandasWorking with Python for Data ScienceIndexing and Selecting Arrays...And Much More!So, ready to get started?Click ""Buy Now""!",0,0,0,1,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54681422-python-for-data-science?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1938,William Wizner,,,2020-07-21,Kindle Edition,,Purchase on Amazon

"Radio Science Data Analysis in ""Venus Express"" and ""Rosetta"": Digital signal processing techniques applied to the reduction of Radio Occultation data",300,0.0,0,1,"The deeper layers of the Venus atmosphere penetrated by the RF carrier signal transmitted by the VEX spacecraft during the atmospheric sounding can cause SNR degradations exceeding 50 dB along with frequency shifts and shift rates up to, respectively, 60 kHz and 2 kHz/s, depending on the observation geometry. Under such conditions, PLL-based receivers are soon driven in Ã¢â¬Åout-of-lockÃ¢â¬Â and data acquisition stops. Coherent sampling of the antenna voltage eliminates real-time tracking of the incoming signal, hence committing to proper digital post-processing techniques the possibility to recover the weak RF signal sunk in the wide-band receiver thermal noise. The iterative processing strategy outlined in this work is based on progressive reduction of the signal dynamics, realized by means of numeric down-conversion and low-pass filtering. The estimate of the signal frequency (the looked-for parameter) which drives the numeric mixer becomes more accurate at each iteration step, as the noise bandwidth is reduced. In this way, the limit to the achievable maximum accuracy is only set by the thermal noise at the receiver and the frequency stability of the source.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14667613-radio-science-data-analysis-in-venus-express-and-rosetta?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1200,Riccardo Mattei,,,,Paperback,,Purchase on Amazon

The widespread deployment of Ã¢â¬ÅBlack boxÃ¢â¬Â algorithms that are difficult or impossible to understand and explain, even for their developers, is a primary source of these unanticipated harms, making modern techniques and methods for manipulating large data sets seem sinister, even dangerous. When put in the hands of authoritarian governments, these algorithms have enabled suppression of political dissent and persecution of minorities. To prevent these harms, data scientists everywhere must come to understand how the algorithms that they build and deploy may harm certain groups or be unfair. Responsible Data Science delivers a comprehensive, practical treatment of how to implement data science solutions in an even-handed and ethical manner that minimizes the risk of undue harm to vulnerable members of society.

No previous experience with machine-learning algorithms is required. Machine learning, the art of creating applications that learn from experience and data, has been around for many years. Python is quickly becoming the go-to language for analysts and data scientists due to its simplicity and flexibility; moreover, within the Python data space, scikit-learn is the unequivocal choice for machine learning. The course combines an introduction to some of the main concepts and methods in machine learning with practical, hands-on examples of real-world problems. The course starts by walking through different methods to prepare your dataÃ¢â¬âbe it a dataset with missing values or text columns that require the categories to be turned into indicator variables. After the data is ready, you'll learn different techniques aligned with different objectivesÃ¢â¬âbe it a dataset with known outcomes such as sales by state, or more complicated problems such as clustering similar customers. Finally, you'll learn how to polish your algorithm to ensure that it's both accurate and resilient to new datasets. You will learn to incorporate machine learning in your applications. Ranging from handwritten digit recognition to document classification, examples are solved step-by-step using scikit-learn and Python. By the end of this course you will have learned how to build applications that learn from experience, by applying the main concepts and techniques of machine learning. Implement scikit-learn using engaging examples and fun exercises, and with a gentle and friendly but comprehensive ""learn-by-doing"" approach. This is a practical course, which analyzes compelling data about life, health, and death with the help of tutorials.

To satisfy an urgent need of many scientists for having at their working place a comprehensive, high quality, but cheap collection of at least the basic data oftheirfield of interest the series ""Data in Science and Technology""is started now. This first volume presents the most important data on two groups of semiconductors, the elements of the IVth group of the periodic system and the III-V compounds. All data were compiled from information on about 2500 pages in various volumes of the New Series of Landolt-Bornstein. For each critically chosen data set and each figure the original literature is cited. In addition, tables of content refer to the handbooks the data were drawn from. Thus the presentation of data in this volume is of the same high quality standard as in the original evaluated data collections.

Statistics for Health Data Science: An Organic Approach,244,0.0,0,1,"Students and researchers in the health sciences are faced with greater opportunity and challenge than ever before. The opportunity stems from the explosion in publicly available data that simultaneously informs and inspires new avenues of investigation. The challenge is that the analytic tools required go far beyond the standard methods and models of basic statistics. This textbook aims to equip health care researchers with the most important elements of a modern health analytics toolkit, drawing from the fields of statistics, health econometrics, and data science.This textbook is designed to overcome studentsÃ¢â¬â¢ anxiety about data and statistics and to help them to become confident users of appropriate analytic methods for health care research studies. Methods are presented organically, with new material building naturally on what has come before. Each technique is motivated by a topical research question, explained in non-technical terms, and accompanied by engaging explanations and examples. In this way, the authors cultivate a deep (Ã¢â¬ÅorganicÃ¢â¬Â) understanding of a range of analytic techniques, their assumptions and data requirements, and their advantages and limitations. They illustrate all lessons via analyses of real data from a variety of publicly available databases, addressing relevant research questions and comparing findings to those of published studies. Ultimately, this textbook is designed to cultivate health services researchers that are thoughtful and well informed about health data science, rather than data analysts. This textbook differs from the competition in its unique blend of methods and its determination to ensure that readers gain an understanding of how, when, and why to apply them. It provides the public health researcher with a way to think analytically about scientific questions, and it offers well-founded guidance for pairing data with methods for valid analysis. Readers should feel emboldened to tackle analysis of real public datasets using traditional statistical models, health econometrics methods, and even predictive algorithms.Accompanying code and data sets are provided in an author site: roman-gulati github io statistics-for-health-data-science",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56775896-statistics-for-health-data-science?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1131,Ruth Etzioni," Micha Mandel, Roman Gulati",,2021-01-05,Hardcover,46.67,Purchase on Goodreads

Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R,402,4.0,4,1,"Text data is important for many domains, from healthcare to marketing to the digital humanities, but specialized approaches are necessary to create features for machine learning from language. Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R explains how to preprocess text data for modeling, train models, and evaluate model performance using tools from the tidyverse and tidymodels ecosystem. Models like these can be used to make predictions for new observations, to understand what natural language features or characteristics contribute to differences in the output, and more. If you are already familiar with the basics of predictive modeling, use the comprehensive, detailed examples in this book to extend your skills to the domain of natural language processing. This book provides practical guidance and directly applicable knowledge for data scientists and analysts who want to integrate unstructured text data into their modeling pipelines. Learn how to use text data for both regression and classification tasks, and how to apply more straightforward algorithms like regularized regression or support vector machines as well as deep learning approaches. Natural language must be dramatically transformed to be ready for computation, so we explore typical text preprocessing and feature engineering steps like tokenization and word embeddings from the ground up. These steps influence model results in ways we can measure, both in terms of model metrics and other tangible consequences such as how fair or appropriate model results are.",1,2,1,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57932638-supervised-machine-learning-for-text-analysis-in-r?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=319,Emil Hvitfeldt, Julia Silge (Goodreads Author),,2021-11-04,Hardcover,47.34,Purchase on Goodreads

Top Challenges in Data Science,155,5.0,1,1,"Data science is a rapidly growing field, and with its growth comes new challenges. In this book, we will explore some of the top challenges facing data scientists today. We will start by discussing the challenge of data preparation. This is the process of cleaning, transforming, and formatting data so that it can be used for analysis. Data preparation can be a time-consuming and challenging task, especially when dealing with large datasets. Next, we will discuss the challenge of model selection. This is the process of choosing the right machine learning model for a particular problem. There are many different machine learning models available, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Choosing the right model can be a difficult task, and it is important to consider the specific problem that you are trying to solve. We will then discuss the challenge of interpreting results. This is the process of understanding what the results of a machine learning model mean. Machine learning models can be very complex, and it can be difficult to understand why they make the predictions that they do. Interpreting results is an important part of data science, and it is essential to be able to explain the results of your models to stakeholders. Finally, we will discuss the challenge of data security. This is the process of protecting data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Data security is an important issue in data science, as the data that data scientists work with is often sensitive. In this book, we will explore these challenges in more detail, and we will provide some tips on how to overcome them. We will also discuss some of the latest trends in data science, and how these trends are addressing some of the challenges that we have discussed. We hope that this book will help you to understand the challenges facing data scientists today, and that it will provide you with some tools and techniques that you can use to overcome these challenges.",1,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193809449-top-challenges-in-data-science?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1325,Anirban   Das,,,2023-07-21,Paperback,,Purchase on Amazon

Predicting the Unknown: The History and Future of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence,281,5.0,1,1,"As a society, weÃ¢â¬â¢re in a constant struggle to control uncertainty and predict the unknown. Quite often, we think of scientific fields and theories as being separate from each other. But a more careful investigation can uncover the common thread that ties many of those together. From ChatGPT, to AmazonÃ¢â¬â¢s Alexa, to AppleÃ¢â¬â¢s Siri, data science, and computer science have become part of our lives. In the meantime, the demand for data scientists has grown, as the field has been increasingly called the Ã¢â¬Åsexiest profession.Ã¢â¬Â This book attempts to specifically cover this gap in literature between data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). How was uncertainty approached historically, and how has it evolved since?

Classical statistics is taught so that readers learn to think critically about the interpretation of data and its common pitfalls. In addition, basic software engineering and computer science skillsets often lacking in data scientists are given a central place in the book. Visualization tools are reviewed, and their central importance in data science is highlighted. The clear communication of technical results, which is perhaps the most undertrained of data science skills, is given its own chapter. All of these are topics explained in the context of solving real-world modern data problems.

Concentrating on decisions involving abortion, sex discrimination, and sexual harassment, they show that the use of such data has increased over the last twenty years, but that the data's use by the court appears to hinge more on the judges' liberal, conservative, or long-held positions and the types of cases involved than on the objectivity or validity of the data.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ By offering insights into how data are used by the Supreme Court, the authors hope to show social scientists how to make their research more suitable for courtroom use and to show the legal community how such data can be used more effectively.

Data Analysis and Signal Processing in Chromatography (Volume 21),413,5.0,1,1,"This book gives an overview of the numerical data analysis and signal treatment techniques that are used in chromatography and related separation techniques. Emphasis is given to the description of the symmetrical and asymmetrical chromatographic peak shape models. Both theoretical and empirical models are discussed. The fundamentals of data acquisition, types and effect of baseline noise, and methods of improving the signal-to-noise ratio (either in time or in frequency and wavelet domain) are thoroughly discussed. Resolution enhancement techniques, such as curve fitting, deconvolution by Fourier and wavelet transforms, iterative deconvolution, Kalman filtering and multivariate methods of curve resolution are all discussed with several chromatographic examples. Quantitative analysis by peak area of peak height measurement, the precision and accuracy of the quantitation of stand-alone or overlapping and symmetrical or asymmetrical peaks are treated. In a separate chapter, guidelines are given for the use of transform techniques for the analysis of chromatograms. A statistical description of peak overlap is given in the final chapters. Since the concept of resolution has to be reconsidered when one separates complex mixtures, the problem of resolution and overlap is quantitatively discussed by means of statistical methods, and by using Fourier analysis of the complex chromatogram. Features of this book Ã¢â¬Â¢ The ultimate source of numerical techniques to enhance chromatographic data Ã¢â¬Â¢ Gives a detailed description of signal and resolution enhancement techniques in a manner applicable for enhancing not only chromatography, but also spectroscopic and other analytical signals Ã¢â¬Â¢ The first book with a thorough overview of the statistics of peak overlap.

Data Science for Beginners and Layman:,393,5.0,1,1," Who this book is written for   We presume that the data scientists reading this book are knowledgeable about data science, common machine learning methods, and popular data science tools, and have in the course of their work run proof of concept studies, and built prototypes. We offer a book that introduces advanced techniques and methods for building data science solutions to this audience, showing them how to construct commercial grade data products for layman and beginners.  ** The Big Data Science Ecosystem ** As a data scientist, you'll no doubt be very familiar with handling files and processing perhaps even large amounts of data. However, as I'm sure you will agree, doing anything more than a simple analysis over a single type of data requires a method of organizing and cataloging data so that it can be managed effectively.  Perspectives on Data Science from a Developer  In this introductory chapter, I'll start the conversation by attempting to answer a few fundamental questions that will hopefully provide context and clarity for the rest of this book: * What is data science and why it's on the rise * Why is data science here to stay * Why do developers need to get involved in data science   Inside the Book   1. Perspectives on Data Science from a Developer 2. Data Science Applications Formats and Terms 3. Machine learning applied to Data Science 4. Machine Learning Algorithms 5. Agility, Machine Learning, and Analytics 6. Using Neural Networks in Data Science 7. Deep Learning Opportunity 8. New Research and Future Directions 9. Why Data Scientists use Machine Learning 10. Unsupervised Learning - Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction 11. Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval 12. Industrial Applications of Machine Learning and Data Science    Why is Data Science on the rise?  There are multiple factors involved in the meteoric rise of data science. First, the amount of data being collected keeps growing at an exponential rate. According to recent market research from the IBM Marketing Cloud something like 2.5 quintillion bytes are created every day (to give you an idea of how big that is, that's 2.5 billion of billion bytes), but yet only a tiny fraction of this data is ever analyzed, leaving tons of missed opportunities on the table.  Second, we're in the midst of a cognitive revolution that started a few years ago; almost every industry is jumping on the AI bandwagon, which includes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.  **Even though these fields existed for a long time,** they have recently enjoyed the renewed attention to the point that they are now among the most popular courses in colleges as well as getting the lion's share of open source activities.  And In the last chapter discussed machine learning analytics in detail. It broadly discussed the uses, applications, challenges, and use cases of machine learning analytics in areas like manufacturing, retail, marketing, sales, banking, and finance.",1,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43366333-data-science-for-beginners-and-layman?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1004,Narendra Mohan Mittal (Goodreads Author),,,2018-12-21,Kindle Edition,,Purchase on Amazon

50 years of data science,41,3.64,11,1,"More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In `TheFuture of Data Analysis', he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whosesubject of interest was learning from data, or `data analysis'. Ten to twenty years ago, JohnChambers, Bill Cleveland and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statisticsto expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers calledfor more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; andBreiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland even suggested thecatchy name \Data Science"" for his envisioned eld.A recent and growing phenomenon is the emergence of \Data Science"" programs at majoruniversities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most recently the Univ. of Michigan, whichon September 8, 2015 announced a $100M \Data Science Initiative"" that will hire 35 new faculty.Teaching in these new programs has signicant overlap in curricular subject matter with tradi-tional statistics courses; in general, though, the new initiatives steer away from close involvementwith academic statistics departments.",3,3,3,2,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36397912-50-years-of-data-science?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1363,David Donoho,,,,ebbok,,Purchase on Amazon

Adventures in Financial Data Science: The Empirical Properties of Financial and Economic Data,,0.0,0,1,"This book provides insights into the true nature of financial and economic data, and is a practical guide on how to analyze a variety of data sources. The focus of the book is on finance and economics, but it also illustrates the use of quantitative analysis and data science in many different areas. Lastly, the book includes practical information on how to store and process data and provides a framework for data driven reasoning about the world. The book begins with entertaining tales from Graham Giller's career in finance, starting with speculating in UK government bonds at the Oxford Post Office, accidentally creating a global instant messaging system that went 'viral' before anybody knew what that meant, on being the person who forgot to hit 'enter' to run a hundred-million dollar statistical arbitrage system, what he decoded from his brief time spent with Jim Simons, and giving Michael Bloomberg a tutorial on Granger Causality. The majority of the content is a narrative of analytic work done on financial, economics, and alternative data, structured around both Dr Giller's professional career and some of the things that just interested him. The goal is to stimulate interest in predictive methods, to give accurate characterizations of the true properties of financial, economic and alternative data, and to share what Richard Feynman described as 'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out.'

"Bayesian Smoothing and Regression for Longitudinal, Spatial and Event History Data",512,3.5,2,1,"Several recent advances in smoothing and semiparametric regression are presented in this book from a unifying, Bayesian perspective. Simulation-based full Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference, as well as empirical Bayes procedures closely related to penalized likelihood estimation and mixed models, are considered here. Throughout, the focus is on semiparametric regression and smoothing based on basis expansions of unknown functions and effects in combination with smoothness priors for the basis coefficients.Beginning with a review of basic methods for smoothing and mixed models, longitudinal data, spatial data and event history data are treated in separate chapters. Worked examples from various fields such as forestry, development economics, medicine and marketing are used to illustrate the statistical methods covered in this book. Most of these examples have been analyzed using implementations in the Bayesian software, BayesX, and some with R Codes.",0,1,1,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12566067-bayesian-smoothing-and-regression-for-longitudinal-spatial-and-event-hi?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=305,Ludwig Fahrmeir, Thomas Kneib,,,Hardcover,,Purchase on Amazon

Data Science for Supply Chain Forecast,237,4.5,16,1,"Data Science for Supply Chain Forecast is a book for practitioners focusing on data science and machine learning; it demonstrates how both are closely interlinked in order to create an advanced forecast for supply chain. As one will discover in this book, artificial intelligence (AI) & machine learning (ML) are not simply a question of coding skills. Using data science in order to solve a problem requires a scientific mindset more than coding skills. The story behind these models is one of experimentation, of observation and of constant questioning; a true scientific method must be applied to supply chain. In the data science field as well as that of the supply chain, simple questions do not come with simple answers. In order to resolve these questions, one needs to be both a scientist as well as to use the correct tools. In this book, we will discuss both. This book has been written for supply chain practitioners, forecasters and analysts who are looking to go the extra mile. You do not need technical IT skills to start using the models of this book. You do not need a dedicated server or expensive software you solely need your own computer. You do not need a PhD in mathematics will only be utilized as a tool to tweak and understand the models. In the majority of the cases Ã¢â¬â especially when it comes to machine learning Ã¢â¬â a deep understanding of the mathematical inner workings of a model will not be necessary in order to optimize it and understand its limitations.

Data Science with Matlab. Classification Techniques,258,0.0,0,1,"Data science includes a set of statistical techniques that allow extracting the knowledge immersed in the data automatically. One of the fundamental tools in data science are classification techniques. This book develops parametric classification supervised techniques such as decision trees and discriminant analysis models. It also develops non-supervised analysis techniques such as cluster analysis.Cluster analysis, also called segmentation analysis or taxonomy analysis, creates groups, or clusters, of data. Clusters are formed in such a way that objects in the same cluster are very similar and objects in different clusters are very distinct. Measures of similarity depend on the application.Decision trees, or classification trees and regression trees, predict responses to data. To predict a response, follow the decisions in the tree from the root (beginning) node downto a leaf node. The leaf node contains the response. Classification trees give responses that are nominal, such as 'true' or 'false'. Regression trees give numeric responses. Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox trees are binary. Each step in a prediction involves checking the value of one predictor (variable).Discriminant analysis is a classification method. It assumes that differen classes generate data based on different Gaussian distributions. To train (create) a classifier, the fitting function estimates the parameters of a Gaussian distribution for each class (see ""Creating Discriminant Analysis Model"" ).-To predict the classes of new data, the trained classifier find the class with the smallest misclassification cost (see ""Prediction Using Discriminant Analysis Models"").Linear discriminant analysis is also known as the Fisher discriminant, named for its inventor.The naive Bayes classifier is designed for use when predictors are independent of one another within each class, but it appears to work well in practice even when that independence assumption is not valid.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48773404-data-science-with-matlab-classification-techniques?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=920,A.

DATA SCIENCE with MATLAB. PREDICTIVE TECHNIQUES: GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS and NONLINEAR REGRESSION,,0.0,0,1,"Data science includes a set of statistical techniques that allow extracting the knowledge immersed in the data automatically. One of the fundamental techniques in data science is the treatment of regression models. Regression is the process of fitting models to data. The models must have numerical responses. The regression process depends on the model. If a model is parametric, regression estimates the parameters from the data. If a model is linear in the parameters, estimation is based on methods from linear algebra that minimize the norm of a residual vector. If a model is nonlinear in the parameters, estimation is based on search methods from optimization that minimize the norm of a residual vector.The outcome of a response variable might be one of a restricted set of possible values. If there are only two possible outcomes, such as a yes or no answer to a question, these responses are called binary responses. If there are multiple outcomes, then they are called polytomous responses. Some examples include the degree of a disease (mild, medium, severe), preferred districts to live in a city, and so on. When the response variable is nominal, there is no natural order among the response variable categories. Nominal response models explain and predict the probability that an observation is in each category of a categorical response variable. A nominal response model is one of several natural extensions of the binary logit model and is also called a multinomial logit model. The multinomial logit model explains the relative risk of being in one category versus being in the reference category, k, using a linear combination of predictor variables. Consequently, the probability of each outcome is expressed as a nonlinear function of p predictor variables. Lasso is a regularization technique for estimating generalized linear models. Lasso includes a penalty term that constrains the size of the estimated coefficients. Therefore, it resembles Ã¢â¬ÅRidge RegressionÃ¢â¬Â . Lasso is a shrinkage estimator: it generates coefficient estimates that are biased to be small. Nevertheless, a lasso estimator can have smaller error than an ordinary maximum likelihood estimator when you apply it to new data. Unlike ridge regression, as the penalty term increases, the lasso technique sets more coefficients to zero. This means that the lasso estimator is a smaller model, with fewer predictors. As such, lasso is an alternative to stepwise regression and other model selection and dimensionality reduction techniques. Elastic net is a related technique. Elastic net is akin to a hybrid of ridge regression and lasso regularization. Like lasso, elastic net can generate reduced models by generating zero-valued coefficients. Empirical studies suggest that the elastic net technique can outperform lasso on data with highly correlated predictors.Generalized linear mixed-effects (GLME) models describe the relationship between a response variable and independent variables using coefficients that can vary with respect to one or more grouping variables, for data with a response variable distribution other than normal. You can think of GLME models as extensions of generalized linear models (GLM) for data that are collected and summarized in groups. Alternatively, you can think of GLME models as a generalization of linear mixed-effects models(LME) for data where the response variable is not normally distributed. A mixed-effects model consists of fixed-effects and random-effects terms. Fixed-effects terms are usually the conventional linear regression part of the model. Random-effects terms are associated with individual experimental units drawn at random from a population, and account for variations between groups that might affect the response. The random effects have prior distributions, whereas the fixed effects do not.",0,0,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48503797-data-science-with-matlab-predictive-techniques?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=1020,A.

"Data Science: Time Complexity, Inferential Uncertainty, and Spacekime Analytics",340,4.5,2,1,"The amount of new information is constantly increasing , faster than our ability to fully interpret and utilize it to improve human experiences. Addressing this asymmetry requires novel and revolutionary scientific methods and effective human and artificial intelligence interfaces. By lifting the concept of time from a positive real number to a 2D complex time ( kime ), this book uncovers a connection between artificial intelligence (AI), data science, and quantum mechanics. It proposes a new mathematical foundation for data science based on raising the 4D spacetime to a higher dimension where longitudinal data (e.g., time-series) are represented as manifolds (e.g., kime-surfaces). This new framework enables the development of innovative data science analytical methods for model-based and model-free scientific inference, derived computed phenotyping, and statistical forecasting. The book provides a transdisciplinary bridge and a pragmatic mechanism to translate quantum mechanical principles, such as particles and wavefunctions, into data science concepts, such as datum and inference-functions. It includes many open mathematical problems that still need to be solved, technological challenges that need to be tackled, and computational statistics algorithms that have to be fully developed and validated. Spacekime analytics provide mechanisms to effectively handle, process, and interpret large, heterogeneous, and continuously-tracked digital information from multiple sources. The authors propose computational methods, probability model-based techniques, and analytical strategies to estimate, approximate, or simulate the complex time phases (kime directions). This allows transforming time-varying data, such as time-series observations, into higher-dimensional manifolds representing complex-valued and kime-indexed surfaces (kime-surfaces). The book includes many illustrations of model-based and model-free spacekime analytic techniques applied to economic forecasting, identification of functional brain activation, and high-dimensional cohort phenotyping. Specific case-study examples include unsupervised clustering using the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (MCSI), model-based inference using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and model-free inference using the UK Biobank data archive. The material includes mathematical, inferential, computational, and philosophical topics such as Heisenberg uncertainty principle and alternative approaches to large sample theory, where a few spacetime observations can be amplified by a series of derived, estimated, or simulated kime-phases. The authors extend Newton-Leibniz calculus of integration and differentiation to the spacekime manifold and discuss possible solutions to some of the problems of time. The coverage also includes 5D spacekime formulations of classical 4D spacetime mathematical equations describing natural laws of physics, as well as, statistical articulation of spacekime analytics in a Bayesian inference framework. The steady increase of the volume and complexity of observed and recorded digital information drives the urgent need to develop novel data analytical strategies. Spacekime analytics represents one new data-analytic approach, which provides a mechanism to understand compound phenomena that are observed as multiplex longitudinal processes and computationally tracked by proxy measures. This book may be of interest to academic scholars, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, artificial intelligence and machine learning engineers, biostatisticians, econometricians, and data analysts. Some of the material may also resonate with philosophers, futurists, astrophysicists, space industry technicians, biomedical researchers, health practitioners, and the general public.",1,1,0,0,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51980789-data-science?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=326,Ivo Dinov, Milen Velchev Velev,,2021-12-20,Hardcover,67.93,Purchase on Goodreads

Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications,136,4.33,6,1,"Data stream algorithms as an active research agenda emerged only over the past few years, even though the concept of making few passes over the data for performing computations has been around since the early days of Automata Theory. The data stream agenda now pervades many branches of Computer Science including databases, networking, knowledge discovery and data mining, and hardware systems. Industry is in synch too, with Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) and special hardware to deal with data speeds. Even beyond Computer Science, data stream concerns are emerging in physics, atmospheric science and statistics. Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications focuses on the algorithmic foundations of data streaming. In the data stream scenario, input arrives very rapidly and there is limited memory to store the input. Algorithms have to work with one or few passes over the data, space less than linear in the input size or time significantly less than the input size. In the past few years, a new theory has emerged for reasoning about algorithms that work within these constraints on space, time and number of passes. Some of the methods rely on metric embeddings, pseudo-random computations, sparse approximation theory and communication complexity. The applications for this scenario include IP network traffic analysis, mining text message streams and processing massive data sets in general. Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications surveys the emerging area of algorithms for processing data streams and associated applications.

Football Hackers: The Science and Art of a Data Revolution,304,4.27,1242,1,"Well written and thoughtful. Takes us on a tour of some of Europe's most innovative football thinkers - Financial Times

The future of football is now.

Football's data revolution has only just begun. The arrival of advanced metrics and detailed analysis is already reshaping the modern game. We can now fully assess player performance, analyse the role of luck and measure what really leads to victory. There is no turning back.

Now the race is on between football's wealthiest clubs and a group of outsiders, nerds and rule-breakers, who are turning the game on its head with their staggering innovations. Winning is no longer just about what happens out on the pitch, it's now a battle taking place in boardrooms and on screens across international borders with the world's brightest minds driving for an edge over their fiercest rivals.

Christoph Biermann has moved in the midst of these disruptive upheavals, talking to scientists, coaches, managers, scouts and psychologists in the world's major clubs, traveling across Europe and the US and revealing the hidden - and often jaw-dropping - truths behind the beautiful game.

Foundations of Data Science,479,4.19,21,1,"Computer science as an academic discipline began in the 1960Ã¢â¬â¢s. Emphasis was on programming languages, compilers, operating systems, and the mathematical theory that supported these areas. Courses in theoretical computer science covered finite automata, regular expressions, context-free languages, and computability. In the 1970Ã¢â¬â¢s, the study of algorithms was added as an important component of theory. The emphasis was on making computers useful. Today, a fundamental change is taking place and the focus is more on a wealth of applications. There are many reasons for this change. The merging of computing and communications has played an important role. The enhanced ability to observe, collect, and store data in the natural sciences, in commerce, and in other fields calls for a change in our understanding of data and how to handle it in the modern setting. The emergence of the web and social networks as central aspects of daily life presents both opportunities and challenges for theory.While traditional areas of computer science remain highly important, increasingly researchers of the future will be involved with using computers to understand and extract usable information from massive data arising in applications, not just how to make computers useful on specific well-defined problems. With this in mind we have written this book to cover the theory we expect to be useful in the next 40 years, just as an understanding of automata theory, algorithms, and related topics gave students an advantage in the last 40 years. One of the major changes is an increase in emphasis on probability, statistics, and numerical methods.Early drafts of the book have been used for both undergraduate and graduate courses. Background material needed for an undergraduate course has been put in the appendix.

Predictive Analytics: How Data Science Predicts What You Are Going to Do,240,3.67,2038,1,"You have been predicted -- by companies, governments, law-enforcement, hospitals and universities. Their computers say, ""I knew you were going to do that!"" These institutions are seizing upon the power to predict whether you're going to click, buy, lie, or die.Why? For good reason: Predicting human behavior combats financial risk, fortifies healthcare, reduces spam, toughens crime-fighting and boosts sales.How? Prediction is powered by the world's most potent, booming unnatural resource: data. Accumulated in large part as the by-product of routine tasks, data is the unsalted, flavorless residue deposited en masse as organizations churn away. Surprise! This heap of refuse is a gold mine. Big data embodies an extraordinary wealth of experience from which to learn.Predictive analytics is the science that unleashes the power of data. With this technology, the computer literally learns from data how to predict the future behavior of individuals. Perfect prediction is not possible, but even lousy predictions can be extremely valuable.In this rich, entertaining primer, former Columbia University professor and Predictive Analytics World co-founder Eric Siegel reveals the power and perils of prediction: What unique form of mortgage risk Chase Bank predicted before the recession.Predicting which people will drop out of school, cancel a subscription or get divorced before they are even aware of it themselves.Why early retirement decreases life expectancy and vegetarians miss fewer flights.Five reasons organizations predict death, including one health insurance company.The way U.S. Bank and European wireless carrier Telenor calculate how to most strongly influence each customer.How companies ascertain untold, private truths -- how Target figures out you're pregnant and Hewlett-Packard deduces you're about to quit your job.How judges and parole boards rely on crime-predicting computers to decide who stays in prison and who goes free.What's predicted by the BBC, Citibank, ConEd, Facebook, Ford, Google, IBM, the IRS, Match.com, MTV, Netflix, Pandora, PayPal, Pfizer, and Wikipedia.A truly omnipresent science, predictive analytics affects everyone, every day. Although largely unseen, it drives millions of decisions, determining who to call, mail, investigate, incarcerate, set up on a date, or medicate.Predictive analytics transcends human perception. This book's final chapter answers the riddle: What often happens to you that cannot be witnessed, and that you can't even be sure has happened afterward -- but that can be predicted in advance?",446,776,567,192,57,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16649210-predictive-analytics?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=80,Eric Siegel,,,,ebbok,17.0,Purchase on Goodreads

Sequencing and Scheduling With Inaccurate Data,442,0.0,0,1,"In many real-world applications, the problems with the data used for scheduling such as processing times, set-up times, release dates or due dates is not exactly known before applying a specific solution algorithm which restricts practical aspects of scheduling theory. During the last decades, several approaches have been developed for sequencing and scheduling with inaccurate data, depending on whether the data is given as random numbers, fuzzy numbers or whether it is uncertain ( it can take values from a given interval). This book considers the four major approaches for dealing with such a stochastic approach, a fuzzy approach, a robust approach and a stability approach. Each of the four parts is devoted to one of these approaches. First, it contains a survey chapter on this subject, as well as between further chapters, presenting some recent research results in the particular area. The book provides the reader with a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction into scheduling with inaccurate data. The four survey chapters deal with scheduling with stochastic approaches, fuzzy job-shop scheduling, min-max regret scheduling problems and a stability approach to sequencing and scheduling under uncertainty.

"Experimental Design: a chemometric approach (Data Handling in Science and Technology, Vol. 3)",286,5.0,1,1,"Now available in a paperback edition is a book which has been described as ``...an exceptionally lucid, easy-to-read presentation... would be an excellent addition to the collection of every analytical chemist. I recommend it with great enthusiasm.'' (Analytical Chemistry). Unlike most current textbooks, it approaches experimental design from the point of view of the experimenter, rather than that of the statistician. As the reviewer in `Analytical Chemistry' went on to ``Deming and Morgan should be given high praise for bringing the principles of experimental design to the level of the practicing analytical chemist.''.The book first introduces the reader to the fundamentals of experimental design. Systems theory, response surface concepts, and basic statistics serve as a basis for the further development of matrix least squares and hypothesis testing. The effects of different experimental designs and different models on the variance-covariance matrix and on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) are extensively discussed. Applications and advanced topics (such as confidence bands, rotatability, and confounding) complete the text. Numerous worked examples are presented.The clear and practical approach adopted by the authors makes the book applicable to a wide audience. It will appeal particularly to those with a practical need (scientists, engineers, managers, research workers) who have completed their formal education but who still need to know efficient ways of carrying out experiments.

It also includes data that is currently stored and can be connected to other data sources for analysis, but the business has not dedicated sufficient resources to analyze and leverage.Ã¢â¬Â Add to this unstructured data of a nature for which sufficiently robust or accurate analysis tools have not yet been invented, and some data (notably most log files) which will simply never be of use and will never yield useful Business Intelligence, commonly known as BI.In DARK DATA & DARK SOCIAL, Lars Nielsen explores then nature of Dark Data, how to go about discerning genuinely useful Dark Data amid the large balance of useless data debris with which most enterprises are swamped, how to build a data science team to accomplish this task and leverage Dark Data to its utmost potential, how to safely and irrevocably dispose of unusable data debris, and also how to exploit the darkest of dark data - ""Dark Social,"" the hard-to-track but incredibly valuable real-time data pegged to largely-anonymous second party referrals to web sites (as opposed to direct click-throughs). Throughout the book, Nielsen provides information in a user-friendly, jargon-free manner which assumes little technical background. Thus the volume is ideal for would-be data scientists as well as managers and marketers working with, or intending to work with, data science teams.CONTENTS: What is Dark Data? * The Ebb and Flood of Data Value * Building a Team to Enlighten Dark Data * The Varying Natures of Dark Data * The Need for Universal Ubiquitous Encryption * Dark Data Retention Policies * The Safe Disposal of Data Debris via Crypto-Shredding and Other Approaches * Summing Up: Recognizing the Value Within Non-Transactional Dark Data and Exploiting Ã¢â¬ÅDark SocialÃ¢â¬ÂABOUT THE AUTHOR: Lars Nielsen is a leading systems analyst and developer living in Amsterdam.
