0,"Gorgeously illustrated, this slim volume is a nice primer for those with little to no exposure to data science. It covers some major basic concepts in a readable way as well as modern and bleeding edge applications of data science. I also liked how it situated data science firmly in the statistical tradition and gave some good introductions to some major historical figures. On the whole, while I didn't learn a lot, I love the art and would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick overview. And I absolutely would love to frame some of the illustrations on my office wall!**thanks to the editor, publisher, and NetGalley for a free copy in exchange for an honest review.

1,"Thanks to NetGalley, authors, and publishers, for the opportunity to read an advanced copy of ""30-Second Data Science"". This book is an excellent introduction to the subject of data and data science, with mesmerizing visual material, related facts to each topic, related brief biographies, highlighted main ideas, and very accessible explanations of topics. Do not expect deep dive into topics, this book does what it says: within a couple of minutes and a couple of pages we get an idea of certain use of data and its characteristics. This is a great tool for students interested in AI, data science, statistics, just to understand what are the uses and main research fields of data usage. It is perfectly visualized and great learning material and introductory tool. The book touches and elaborates the main uses of data and characteristics of uses in each of the below fields: -daily use of data-business use of data-social/ethical use of data-medical data & biostatistics-predictive analytics-decision making in uncertainty ( my personal favorite and research topic) -logistics and business process optimization -shopping, surveillance, and other uses. Needless to say, this is a definitely 5-star read for me. The amount of research and accessibility for the researches in all academical fields, language, and logical reasoning and transitions, made this book an exceptional material for both students.I am going to use this in my classes of the theory of psychological research as a mandatory, introductory read, as well as my small research group. If possible, please share a copy of this book upon printing, I'd definitely treasure it in my library.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51181047/reviews
2,"This is a good summary book of the main principles and figures in data science. If you have no previous knowledge of the subject, I don't think this is the right guide to learn. But as a review/reference, it would be handy for a classroom. The book design is very nice. I normally don't pay a lot of attention to forewords, but this one was kind of a non-sequitur, and even contained an apparent error in the name of the professor's institution--it's the Faculty of Arts AND Sciences, not OF. Anyway. I also really liked the sidebars of ""3-second samples"" and ""3-second analyses""--they would be great to use with a classroom. Thank you to the publishers and NetGalley for the opportunity to review a temporary digital ARC in exchange for an unbiased review.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51181047/reviews
3,"Found this book in my local library. Data science is one of my many interests so I decided to read this one.I think that it's a great book for those just getting started with data science. It doesn't have too much information, and even has smaller paragraphs, summing up things. At the beginning of each section, they had a glossary of key terms, but it would have been better, if it was also included at the bottom of the page that I was reading. For example, I'm reading something that has the term 'causation' in it. I can't remember what it means so I have to go all the way to the beginning of the section.I also think that the book would have benefited from featuring more diverse data scientists. But it's just a reflection of the kind of people that usually get the attention.As I mentioned before, it's an okay book for somebody interested in data science. You can explore many different topics, and then look them up in more detail, if anything catches your eye. The book is also very visually appealing, which was another reason why I wanted to take it home with me.", 3 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51181047/reviews
4,"This book is a great read if you are looking to some concise introductions of the principles and main concepts used in the complex field of data science. With data management and evaluation a driving force between a large range of industries and fields - from AI, sports, dating and medicine, to mention only a few - it is important to realize, through simple everyday life examples - what is the relevance of the data models and patterns. In addition, the readers are also introduced to important historical names that pioneered the use of data science. I was particularly impressed by the graphic part with inspiring illustrations pertinent to the topics explained.Disclaimer: Book offered by the publisher in exchange for an honest review", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51181047/reviews
5,"I have read other books in the 30-second series, so I am familiar with the format. As a novice to the field of data science, this does give a decent overview of theories from a variety of fields such as computing, mathematics, economics and even philosophy. This multi-disciplinary approach is really engaging and you can come away from the book feeling relatively well informed! And you can take it to the bare minimum or go further. If you are in a scientific/mathematical field, or just looking to enhance your knowledge, this is the book for you.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51181047/reviews

8,"Quick and easy read! The book does a good job of explaining complex and academic terms related to statistics and data science in lay-man language. The graphics and design of the book suit the topic. The information has been presented in digestible chunks with a focus on real life applications. This approach to explaining topics is effective and consistent throught the book. I would recommend it as a must-read for anyone interested in the role of data and statistics in our everyday lives. Besides being a good introduction to data science for people from various fields, it could also serve as a source for gathering general knowledge and interesting facts about AI, computer science, big data etc. (such as while preparing for quizzes). The book also prompts the reader to question and reflect on the world they inherit--its systems, flaws, and nuances. Ultimately, it is about so much more than what one may think encompasses “data science”.

13,"First, let's get one thing out of the way: Data Science is tricky. It's translating business questions, requirements, and needs into actionable insights. It's designing and interpreting the result of data-driven experiments. It's machine-learning and A.I. It's statistics. It's math. It's everywhere, and it's hard.While there are no shortage of books out there that seek to aid the prospective product manager or software developer in preparing for interviews in their respective fields, this is the only book in its class for data scientists that covers what you'd need in terms of:1. behavioral interview preparation2. probability3. statistics4. coding and databases5. machine learning6. product sense7. use casesNick and Kevin deserve a lot of praise because a lot of the material in the book would be totally inaccessible to candidates without any experience in some tech/social media. In this book, you'll find contextualized (and some not so) practice questions for FAANG companies as well as finance, and Wall Street. The material is invaluable for this alone.If I could make a recommendation based on my interview journey thus far, it would be to include material that deals with the shapes of real-world distributions i.e. ""what do you think the distribution of time spent per day on Facebook looks like?”Overall, top-notch, highest possible recommendation!", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58949285/reviews

16,"The chapter covering databases is very brief and doesn't get into the details of how data scientists/engineers use the tools or how the skills are tested. Also, the choice of postgres syntax seemed arbitrary, as mySQL varieties are more common. The mathematics sections were more thorough but in my experience less relevant in interviews (unless you're doing research). Overall the questions were good and worth the time to solve, but the choice of material did not reflect my experience either in interviewing data science candidates or in being interviewed for data science and ml engineering roles. The focus in interviews I've seen is most often on experiment design, SQL, and software engineering, which were less of a focus in this book than the probability/stats/ml math sections.", 3 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58949285/reviews

25,"I really wanted to love this book. The concept of walking through a quite elaborate example is excellent. I think it shows many of the pit falls and iterations you need to do from start to finished data product. However, as one of the other reviews also points out, the code example in there are unfinished and the instructions are hard to follow. For me it started in chapter 4, where you are asked to run the first piece of code to convert data. However, I wasn't sure where to run it and it took me a while to figure out it was supposed to be executed in Spark. Probably just me being slow.Once I booted spark up it would still not run, as there was a piece of missing initialization data which I only found once I looked in another branch on git. That was just the beginning. Once I got to connecting Flask and Mongo it really went downhill as the versions weren't compatible. So if the code gets some polish and a ready to use image for Vagrant and EC2 that would work, then it will be a 5-star book. ", 2 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30014113/reviews
26,"It's a good book for programmer or data science beginner level to know the data science concept and popular tool-set in the industry.However the book is not up-to-date to keep with the latest software version. Thus some of the codes in the book are not working as expected(Too bad..). So it means the quality of the book is under the standard.For example, it's using pyElasticsearch package however it's only support ElasticSearch (<2.0) version. It's an ok book and needs more polished in my opinion. ", 2 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30014113/reviews
27,"Favorite quotes:- ""In data science, by contrast to software engineering, code shouldn't always be good; it should be eventually good.""- ""In Agile Data Science, we value generalists over specialists...Examples of good Agile Data Science team members include: Designers who deliver working CSS; Web developers who build entire applications and understand the user interface and user experience; Data scientists capable of both research and building web services and applications; Researchers who check in working source code, explain results, and share intermediate data; Product managers able to understand the nuances in all areas""- ""In data products, the data is ruthlessly opinionated. Whatever we wish the data to say, it is unconcerned with our own opinions. It says what it says. This means the waterfall model has no application. It also means that mocks are an insufficient blueprint to establish consensus in software teams.""- ""Extracted features from unstructured data get cleaned only in the harsh light of day, as users consume them and complain; if you can't ship your features as you extract them, you're in a state of free fall. The hardest part of building data products is pegging entity and feature extraction to products smaller than your ultimate vision. This is why schemas must start as blobs of unstructured text and evolve into structured data only as features are extracted.Features must be exposed in some product form as they are created, or they will never achieve a product-ready state. Derived data that lives in the basement of your product is unlikely to shape up. It is better to create entity pages to bring entities up to a ""consumer-grade"" form, to incrementally improve these entities, and to progressively combine them than to try to expose myriad derived data in a grand vision from the get-go.""- ""Rare is the chart that tells a story. This is because most people make a chart and move on… when in reality, you have to iteratively create and improve charts to achieve useful visualizations... You can create charts in an ad hoc way at first, but as you progress, your workflow should become increasingly automated and reproducible.""-""Agile Data Science is an approach to data science centered around web application development. It asserts that the most effective output of the data science process suitable for effecting change in an organization is the web application. It asserts that application development is a fundamental skill of a data scientist. Therefore, doing data science becomes about building applications that describe the applied research process: rapid prototyping, exploratory data analysis, interactive visualization, and applied machine learning.""", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30014113/reviews

29,"This book describes Russell's perspectives on good data science workflow using an agile methodology. He walks through a project about airline flight data in great detail and shows off some really neat tricks for building web apps and doing predictive analytics at scale. I would describe the material at intermediate level, where the reader should already be familiar with the data science ecosystem.I loved chapter 2, which introduces the technology stack. It's awesome to see minimal working snippets from a whole lineup of open source tools that comprise Russell's pipeline. In particular the Ariflow section her is quite nice. In the remainder of the book, we see how to pull these technologies together.As others have mentioned, the code is not 100% plug and play. This is hardly surprising given the quickly evolving nature of open source, and particularly how new his tools are. Sure, you could pick up a book on MySQL and run most of the code without issue, but Russell is working with much newer (and frankly more interesting) technologies. From my perspective, I am not running any code from the book but just reading through and noting code that will make great reference later. A couple issues that did bother me was the occasional typo, repeated code block or missing attention to detail in presentation. But don't let that stop you from checking out this excellent book.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30014113/reviews
30,"I'm not sure anyone comes to Goodreads for textbook reviews, but I read it so I'm reviewing it briefly...3.5 stars. It's a good use-case for getting a web app up and running that includes a machine learning model and that scales easily. The title isn't kidding when it says full-stack, the case here leverages: MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Airflow, numerous Python (Flask, sci-kit learn, etc...) libraries, and more all with Spark (through Pyspark) as the primary engine. It's probably most useful as a primer on building a Spark based machine learning model and, most importantly, deploying it. I'd say it requires a cursory-to-intermediate understanding of most of the technologies included. It's getting a bit long in the tooth now that it's almost 5 years old, but if you know enough to follow along, you probably know where any potential deprecations lie. I thought it was helpful for those with an intermediate Data Science background. ", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30014113/reviews

Analyzing Social Science Data guides students in: problems with the initial data; problems with the initial variables; how to handle too much data; how to generalize; problems of analyzing single variables; problems examining bivariate relationships; and problems examining multivariate relationshipsThe book is a tour de force in making data analysis manageable and rewarding for today′s undergraduate studying research methods.`I′m full of admiration for this book. Once again, David de Vaus has come up with a superb book that is well written and organized and which will be a boon to a wide range of students. He has taken a vast array of problems that users of quantitative data analysis procedures are likely to encounter. The selection of issues and problems ... reflects the experience of a true practitioner with a grasp of his field and of the intricacies of the research process. The selection of issues clearly derives also from experience of teaching students how to do research and analyse data....A large number of practitioners will want the book. I was surprised at how much I learned from this. This will be a vital book for the bookshelves of practitioners of the craft of quantitative data analysis′ -

I did a master in Data Mining so I already knew them, but the author provides a practical framework and approach for almost everything you need to develop as a data lead so it's useful also for the ones with more experience. The text becomes a little too repetitive (concepts and examples) and has a more high-level approach than I expected (many parts are written in the style of a textbook while using more of his personal experience and challenges could be more useful, I guess). It's clear that he loves to teach: all the main algorithms are explained in a very easy to understand way and also the steps of every processes (in some moments it even reminds me of the ""For Dummies"" series, but with a more academic language).I found the Analytics Hub and Spoke Analytics section interesting and also the last chapters in which he explores score development, data monetization, envisioning and chief data monetization officer role.", 3 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26518722/reviews

82,"The book is aimed at the business community involved with the delivery of business benefit by the use of Data Science and Big Data. It covers a range of benefits and is not restricted to just increased revenue. Following an introductory section, the book contains 4 major parts and 15 chapters.The content takes the reader through the stages of establishing a “Business Strategy for Big Data” rather than the more commonly seen approach of developing a “Big Data Strategy”, i.e. the use of Big Data without a business purpose to guide its delivery. The author is quite clear that the latter is not as advantageous as the former. In fact, it is also clear from the book that for Big Data to be a successful service to the business, the Business Strategy is key, and that the Business must take a more central role in the Big Data operation. This is emphasised in the book by the statement that, in the past, the Business handed over responsibility to IT for Data Warehousing, with the implication that, for Big Data, the same is happening.There was recently an article on LinkedIn which presented the view that “Hadoop is Failing” whether this is correct or not is not relevant to this review but a lot of the facts being presented in the article seemed to be raised and answered by the contents of the book. Perhaps this highlights the need for businesses to take on board the concepts raised by the author.This is the second book written by Bill Schmarzo with the first being aimed at an IT audience, but he felt that there were potentially bigger winners in the Business community and hence this second book. This focus on business can be clearly seen in the four main parts to the book, P1 - Business Potential for Big Data, P2 - Data Science, P3 - Data Science for Business Stakeholders and finally P4 - Building Cross Organisational Support.Part 1 - Business Potential of Big Data, takes the reader through building the foundations of a business strategy that uses Big Data, rather than a Big Data strategy, for the organisation, therefore, paving the way for whether the dog wags the tail or vice versa. As part of this the Big Data Business Model Maturity Index is introduced and explained. This is a five-step index which places a business along the path of using Big Data to, at step one, monitor the business and at the top, step five, to undertake a metamorphosis of the business. The three intermediary steps take the business through insight, optimisation and monetisation (the creation of new sources of income).Part 2 - Data Science, is a scene setting section to the data science concept as a precursor to moving the reader into the utilising those concepts from a business perspective. This is done by introducing several different analytical algorithms and when/where they might be appropriate to use. This is demonstrated by utilising a dummy company on which the algorithms can be deployed. The final chapter introduces the Data Lake and how this has allowed businesses to expand the data they can analyse, while being able to reduce the cost of storing the data in a usable form. This can be viewed in another way by comparing the storage capabilities and costs of the Data Warehouse against those of the Data Lake.Part 3 - Data Science for Business Stakeholders, this section builds on Part 2 by enabling the business stakeholders to think like data scientists and identify what data and algorithms are fundamental to the business, and the decisions that the business must make. This is done by providing a framework that enables the business stakeholders to communicate and work with data scientists, by using a common understanding of the data and algorithms. In simple terms, it is not just about ‘more data’ but also understanding what the business could get from the ‘correct analysis’ of that data.Part 4 - Building Cross Organisational Support, this final part of the book provides a foundation for transforming (metamorphosis) of the business, to better integrate Big Data, in its widest sense, into that business from both an organisation and cultural perspective. Including those of a human, procedural and roles/responsibilities nature, thus allowing that business to achieve the fifth step of Business Metamorphosis. The final chapter of this part, and of the book, is ‘Stories’, a section on Big Data deployment that, it is hoped, inspires the reader, perhaps allowing them to draft their own stories that fit their own organisations.Review by Len Keighley FBCS CEng CITPOriginally published: http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/...", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26518722/reviews

131,"Matt Taddy's Business Data Science should be required reading for anyone doing applied econometrics in 2019. While the title makes it sound like any one of dozens of books on introductory statistics for business rehashing 30 or even 100 year old material for bored business school students in a mandatory class, this is actually a tastefully arranged tour and hands on introduction to the tools and practices that a current day data scientist at a top tier company will use in solving real business problems, by an economist with practical experience at Ebay, Microsoft, and Amazon as well as an academic record spanning top tier publications in both economics and ML. Concretely, that means while it eases you in with basic regression, it proceeds quickly to modern statistical learning tools, starting with the bootstrap, moving to regularized regression and classification, and reaching to tree based methods and unsupervised learning, all accompanied by in line code (in R) and abundant practical advice from years of real world experience. The selection of topics is opinionated rather than encyclopedic; methods that are found useful, including particular variants of the lasso, get detailed code examples, often coming from Taddy's own research, while methods which are now mostly passé, like SVMs, get a dismissive sentence or two, which is appropriate for an introduction. The general subject matter and style is comparable to books like Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman's ""Elements of Statistical Learning"" and Efron and Hastie's ""Computer Age Statistical Inference"", but the focus, applications, and presumed reader knowledge are targeted to business and economics in a way which will make it a better introduction for that class of readers.One of the real standout features of this book is the real data examples, for which the real code introduces you, through learning by doing, to the kinds of data cleaning and formatting and computational implementation details (like the very nice coverage of sparse matrix and parallel and distributed computing facilities in R, along with candid admissions of when Python would be preferred instead) that make up so much of the work life of the professional data scientist but are nowhere to be seen in your typical intro class where students work with mtcars, iris, UCI repository data sets and MNIST, etc. There are some of these canned data sets in the book for simple examples, but enough real ones that you get the feel for it.) Having all of this inline, rather than hidden away or in some special ""data cleaning"" chapter, makes for a bit more challenging reading for the reader not well versed in R, and I personally kept an R terminal open while reading to try out bits needing clarification, but presenting it as it came up for the specific issues for each specific data set kept it manageable while also demonstrating what it requires in practice. The ""Business"" in the title is not just because the author taught in a business school; not just business and economic examples, but careful thought about when and how the methods should be used for business goals are integrated throughout. Causal inference gets two chapters, covering experiments and control, which go over AB testing and a quick run through the ""Mostly Harmless"" playbook that makes up most of the distinctive econometric knowledge of many applied economists (IV, RD, Diff-in-diff, you know the drill), but also more recent methods incorporating machine learning components, like variants of orthogonal (""Doubly robust"") estimators and causal trees and forests for high dimensional control and heterogeneous treatment effects estimation. The discussion of demand estimation here is particularly well informed. Much of Taddy's own work has been on use of text data, and the discussion is highly practical, focusing on preprocessing tasks and issues with use an interpretation of simple methods, like lasso and partial least squares text regression on the supervised side and PCA and LDA on the unsupervised side. This, like the book's heavy focus on lasso methods, reflects a taste for simple, scalable, and interpretable methods with stable well-established implementations which is appropriate both for an introductory text and for real business decisions, which require input that takes both data and real thinking rather than just ML black boxes. Deep learning is postponed to the last chapter, which is more descriptive than instructional, which may be disappointing for people swept up in the hype (and those unfortunate engineers at companies that mandate all data analysis be performed remotely via a Tensorflow API), but is defensible for the business and economics intended audience. I personally introduce a little bit of Keras when teaching similar material just to demonstrate that deep learning is no more challenging than any of the rest of the material, but given how fast the frameworks change and the abundance of alternative resources, it's fine to leave it out.In terms of complaints, aside from not having released the book earlier when I was teaching classes on similar material and had to build up notes from scattered papers and software guides, I don't have many. Some of the figures and math notation get jumbled up or cut off in the Kindle edition, which is a minor annoyance. The included subsection on inference for the lasso, while appropriately heavily caveated, gives readers by its very presence the pernicious idea that ""standard errors for lasso coefficients"" is an idea that makes any sense at all, rather than an elementary misunderstanding that overzealous and underinformed referees should be persuaded out of. Specifically, in high dimensions where a bias variance tradeoff is unavoidable, valid confidence intervals ""for"" a regularized estimator cannot be made to be centered on the estimates (at least not without being massively inflated). One can produce intervals for the underlying model, or for particular functionals of the model, but jointly achieving rate optimal predictions and rate optimal valid (frequentist) inference for a model of this type is known to be simply impossible (Giné and Nickl's book is a useful source on this). The proposed purely heuristic approaches, based on undersmoothing and subsampling, seem unnecessary given that the later causal chapter covers a semiparametric approach for estimation of functionals which is demonstrably fit for purpose. As a matter of disclosure, I have not personally been forced into this by misguided editor or referee, but I have repeatedly been told by economists reluctant to use machine learning or even classical nonparametric methods that expected editors' demands for valid confidence intervals are holding them back from applying them. So devising potemkin methods designed only to get an editor off your back without genuinely solving the problem rather than forcefully explaining what cannot and can be done here (including valid inference as a separate task from point estimation!) seems like a missed opportunity.Overall, this book is an incomparable resource, bringing modern data science practices into reach for applied economists, who even at the forefront could learn a lot of immediate practical relevance from it.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42167523/reviews
132,"Useful in that Taddy outlines which techniques are actually used in industry and why others - including the well-known - are not.

You'll also get clear thinking about the difference between prediction and inference and where each can be used in the modern firm.There are substantial errors in the equations and code, and I could not find any published errata list, which makes this four stars instead of five.

157,"Data visualization is a series of processes of displaying data or information in a form that is not difficult to understand, such as pictures, graphs, numbers, charts and so on. Data visualization is able to simplify the collection of all data to be presented.The use of visual elements in this method greatly facilitates readers in seeing and understanding patterns, outliers, and trends from a data. This method will also enable decision makers to make the right decisions by looking at data analysis in visual form.However, the application of the use of data visualization must also be accompanied by a clear understanding of the reasons why this is so important, what are the types, and what tools are used.Data visualization is important in the scope of the company which aims to assist decision making in a timely and accurate manner. Because, through data visualization we will be invited to understand something visually and interestingly. So understanding about something will also be much easier to do.The reason is, many people find it difficult when they are required to understand an analysis result by simply reading it in writing. Why can this happen? This happens because basically the way our brain works is much faster in responding to data visually such as images, graphs, charts, and so on.An effective visualization must be able to explain the data presented well and arouse the curiosity of the reader. Chart settings not only explain the underlying data, but also allow the reader to isolate problematic areas (eg sub-optimal product sales) for further analysis.A data analyst also needs tools to support daily activities, one of which is data visualization. In short, data visualization or data visualization is the process of changing data so that it is simpler to display. The form of data is usually in an attractive graphic or visual. Data visualization helps you in your presentation, so that it's easier for your audience to understand what you mean.The answer behind the question of why data visualization is so important is because it will be very difficult for us to search and collect large amounts of information at the same time. Even more so if the information is still in raw or written form.So, therefore we need data that is displayed visually to make it easier to understand the data in a short time. Understanding the data that has been obtained does not take much time and of course this is accurate which will make it easier for the reader to make decisions.Please visit this resource for more information about Data Visualization Books.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70236779/reviews

163,"There are many perspectives on what Data Science actually is. This book helped me prepare a lecture on the topic by covering a more-or-less standard view that data science is the combination of many related math/stats/machine-learning/programming fields combined with domain expertise. The footnotes and references were especially helpful. One of the best was: Battle of the Data Science Venn Diagrams. by David Taylor on KDnuggets, October 2016.This is not a book that I would recommend to anyone that knows much (anything?) about data science. It is a fine introduction for people coming from outside of the field. There are too many practical data science books to mention even the really good ones, but one of the best I've taught from is: R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data which is simply outstanding (there is also a free online version: at the author's website). I recently picked up another interesting book The Data Science Handbook, which uses Python goes into more detail on machine learning methods.If you dig a little you might think that you have to choose between Python and R for this sort of work, but this is no longer required. Historically R has often been paired with other languages when data wrangling, text munging or database interfaces were better done in another language (a lot of people learned Perl to do this in bioinformatics). Ruby is also good for glue code in data science projects, but Python has taken over as the most popular for many high-level tasks (especially in ML thanks to Google and the TensorFlow library). In my humble opinion R remains stronger for pure stats work. The real point is that you no longer have to choose. The two languages play extremely well together.

165,"Libros, Amazon y yoSiempre he tenido esa sensación que un libro te escoge, es decir que un día cualquier vas caminando por algún lugar y ves un libro que en tu vida has visto o te ha comentado, pero algo te llama la atención de él que decides recogerlo y comprarlo. Esto me pasa muy seguido en las librerías, ya que hay más libros y por lo tanto hay una probabilidad mayor de que un libro te escoja.Este libro no vino de una librería y ni de verlo en alguna caminata, sino vino de una recomendación de Amazon. Con cualquier recomendación de me hace Amazon generalmente lo que hago es reviso las críticas que han hecho en su propio sitio y en goodreads (que creo que igual le pertenece a Amazon), si es que el libro resulta interesante generó una revisión histórica de precios para verificar que sea un buen momento para comprarlo o en su caso le genero un seguimiento para poder comprar cuando este en un precio mínimo. Con este libro hice este mismo proceso, pero lo que me ocurrió fue algo curioso y es que el libro tiene su versión en inglés, lo que es comprensible por el tema, y además de ambas versiones no se llevan demasiado tiempo de una a otra como sucede con otros libros, sin embargo lo curioso de esto es que los dos tenían un precio similar (15 pesos de diferencia cuando hice la consulta, pero menos de 2 cuando hice la compra), pero uno era vendido por Amazon EUA y el otro por Amazon México, y el libro en español era editado en EUA, además obviamente de tratar el mismo tema y ser de la misma editorial.Se me hace curioso esto ya que cómo es que Amazon me haya recomendado un libro en español, cuando existe la versión en inglés que está mejor calificada en su sitio, sea un primera edición, editada en EUA y además vendida con el sitio de Amazon EUA. Mi primer pensamiento fue que era por el precio, pero ¿realmente valen esos 15 pesos extras toda la logística que implica traer un libro desde EUA? ¿O es porque hablo español y claro está, sería mejor algo en mi idioma materno? En fin, estuve con eso en mi mente y decidiendo que versión comprar: la versión en inglés con el atractivo de poder tener una referencia a la mano con conceptos básicos y sus acrónimos, que se usan mucho en este tipo de libros y que muchas veces se usa ese acrónimo en vez del concepto o comprar la versión en español que me daría igual esos conceptos a la mano, pero con la posible pérdida de información de esos acrónimos que son tan útiles cuando regresas a un libro por algo de información y con temor de que la traducción no sea tan acorde a la idea que presenta el autor... Me decidí por el libro en español.La ciencia de datos como sistemaEste libro trata de la ciencia de datos como un todo, generalmente cuando nos comentan acerca de la ciencia de datos generalmente se nos viene a la mente cosas como algoritmos de aprendizaje, redes neuronales, aprendizaje profundo, etc, y claro está toda la matemática asociada a ella. Claro está que este libro trata de eso, sin embargo, no es lo único de lo que trata ya que además revisa los procesos que están antes de que inclusive pasemos a la recolección de datos y las implicaciones éticas y morales que contrae tener un proyecto de ciencia de datos.  Para muchas personas el hecho de tener un libo que no hable con ecuaciones, de matemática o de algoritmos en este campo hace que sea considerado un libro de dudosa calidad, sin embargo, está parte de la ciencia de datos es la que menos trabajo lleva dentro de un proyecto de ciencia de datos y es que muchos de estos algoritmos ya se encuentran hechos y como se dice: ""no se debe reinventar la rueda cada vez"". Toda esta parte que está detrás de los proyectos de ciencia de datos, de dónde se extraerán los datos, los tipos de datos que se necesitan, la limpieza y carga de los mismos y si realmente podemos usarlos para los fines que perseguimos son incluso más importantes para los proyectos de ciencia de datos, ya que estas actividades son cruciales para que tengamos un proyecto de ciencia de datos exitoso. El libro hace una excelente traducción de los conceptos tratados en la ciencia de datos y aunque tiene ciertos errores en la traducción en el sentido de que quisieron respetar lo más posible el texto original que no hace mucho sentido en español. Igualmente con los acrónimos se hace un excelente trabajo ya que se respeta el acónimo en inglés, pero se coloca el significado el español, lo que hace que sea sencillo el que este libro sea una referencia futura.La luz en la ciencia de datosExiste un viejo chiste concerniente a la ciencia de datos: “El Big data es como el sexo en la adolescencia: todo el mundo habla de ello, nadie sabe realmente cómo hacerlo, todos piensan que los demás lo están haciendo, así que todos dicen que también lo hacen”. Me parece que este chiste se puede extrapolar a la ciencia de datos, ya que los que estamos interesado en ella, generalmente tenemos una barrera de entrada alta, puesto que todos la mayoría de los cursos y videos hablan de ella como una arte mística y obscura que solo los matemáticos y algunos magos pueden entender. Al leer este libro me di cuenta que muchas cosas de ciencia de datos son cosas que ya sabía previamente, como los algoritmos de aprendizaje o las redes neuronales, inclusive cuando en algún trabajo una de las actividades clave revisar a profundidad si es posible usar los datos con lo que se iban a trabajar.  Un toque no todos tienenUn libro que hace da referencias a más libros se me hace un gran libro y es que indica que los autores indiquen un camino por el que podemos continuar con el aprendizaje. Este libro no solo tiene referencias dentro del texto, sino que tiene una sección completa de lecturas adicionales, además como un buen texto académico, tiene todas las referencias en usan para poder ir con más profundidad en los temas que mas nos interesen.¿Es para mi?Este libro va dirigido a personas con que tienen el interés por adentrarse en la ciencia de datos, esas personas que han hecho quizá un par de cursos online, pero se quedaron con dudas acerca de que si entendieron todo y que existe más allá, el libro maneja muy pocas formulas, pero si es necesario tener algo de contexto de programación, como el saber qué es una instancia o una base de datos. Es un libro de entrada, de consulta y referencia, además de que da una visión global de lo que es y de lo que no es ciencia de datos.Pensamientos finalesPara finalizar la historia inicial, después de leer el libro pude darme cuenta todo lo que Amazon conoce de mi, como es que yo con mis gustos y compras que he hecho en la plataforma, pudo recomendarme un libro del cuál no tenia idea que existía, de una edición que no hubiese comprado y con un precio más alto del que hubiera comprado, da algo de miedo saber lo mucho que saben de uno, pero también es interesante saber cómo esa recomendación puso en mis manos un libro que disfruté bastante.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36722689/reviews
166,"I think a more clear title to this book would be ""Introduction to Data Science"". While one may be able to infer that, it was definitely written for an audience that knows very little about what Data Science is and is looking to have a general overview. For that, I felt the book did a very good job. It covered a lot of the basic topics, but none of them very in depth (no math! haha). It also had good discussion around the business and ethics sides of Data Science, as well as its ongoing integration into society.It was probably a little more basic and overview style than I was really looking for given my current knowledge, but a good resource for anyone thinking about moving into Data Science or just wanting to know more about it.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36722689/reviews

168,"Appropriately TitledData Science is a sterling examplar of the excellent MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series (itself an analog of the also excellent Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press). Both series present concise overviews of a particular topics from a leader in the field; and coming as they do from academic presses, tend to have both Notes (inexplicably, endnotes rather than footnotes--when will this insanity end?) and Further Reading sections (Data Science adds a Glossary which some readers may find helpful).The book is structured as seven brief chapters:1. What Is Data Science?2. What Are Data, and What Is a Data Set?3. A Data Science Ecosystem4. Machine Learning 1015. Standard Data Science Tasks6. Privacy and Ethics7. Future Trends and Principles of SuccessThe first and last chapters were, for me, the most helpful. In the real world, ""data science"" is ill-defined. In theory, it spans many disciplines: computer science and programming, machine learning, statistics, mathematics, and logic. It also includes subjective attributes including creativity, communication, critical thinking, and domain expertise. In practice, the definition is more straightforward: an ability to code, along with some statistical knowledge.Chapter 1 begins with a definitional answer: ""Data science encompasses a set of principles, problem definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting non-obvious and useful patterns from large data sets"" (p. 1). It provides a historical overview (""dating back to the 1990s"", p. 6) and highlights areas of use (government, sports, and ""nearly all parts of modern societies"", p. 24). It notes data science's definitional confusion by pointing to a public lecture in 1997 which proposed that the field of statistics should be renamed ""data science"" (p. 17). And there is an excellent illustration (Figure 1, p. 20) that depicts many of the characteristics that a data scientist should have.(With 20 years of experience in the field, it has been my observation that the practical definition of a data scientist is far less robust, focused only on the coding and statistics attributes. Think of a data scientist as a chef. A chef combines myriad ingredients to produce something new (and useful) to others. Yet few, if any, chefs are organic chemists--this humorous example with Julia Child notwithstanding. The vast majority of today's employed data scientists are organic chemists; the world of data needs more chefs).For current or aspiring data science practitioners, Chapter 7 is worth the price of the book. In a subsection titled ""Data Science Project Principles: Why Projects Succeed or Fail"" (pp. 225-ff.), the authors--who can only be speaking from hands-on experience--outline the necessities of any data science project. Ironically, for such a statistically focused undertaking, success is not just a function of the statistical or mathematical goodness of a particular model; rather, it incorporates several exogenous factors, including management support, explainability to a constituency, teamwork and input among stakeholders, business integration, and other subjective factors.Like other titles in the series, Data Science should be helpful to a broad range of users. While the specialist or practitioner won't learn any technical tidbits, they should have their existing views reinforced (or new ones illuminated); and for the layperson, it is an excellent overview.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36722689/reviews

The series of slender, beautifully produced books (lovely paper, clean font etc) cover all manner of topics at an introductory level and are a handy way into a new field. This was not a disappointment. I was delighted to find I recalled the basics re data warehousing and very large databases, but also to get the fundamentals of neural nets, and newer tech underlying the buzzword area of data science. The chapter on ethics was particularly fascinating and the book is filled with case studies which illustrate their points. If you think data science doesn't affect your life then think again. It underpins customer loyalty schemes, companies predicting which customers will change to a new provider (and how to prevent that), policing, medical advances, traffic flow management and much more.You won't find code here, it's an overview and introduction to the key topics, but even for nontech readers it should provide a good answer to What is Data Science and Why should I Care?Disclosure - I know one of the authors, but this is an honest review", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36722689/reviews

177,"This is a pretty dry and not-very-well written intro to data science. It does a reasonable job of explaining most of the definitions, although it will frequently throw in terms it hasn't yet defined at that point. It's completely stripped of explorative narrative structure, with the occasional deterministic example thrown in here and there. It may also repeat introductions to ideas, like it did with Hadoop, where it introduces it twice, only a few paragraphs apart. It's also strangely disproportionate in its introductions. For example, it discusses OLAP and SQL as if they were two sides of a boring slice of bread, and then refers to in-memory ML with such strong golden-egg rhetoric that you wonder if the author has an in-memory ML start-up. The chapters were also too long. Although they utilised sub-sections, the chapters could have been broken up further for ease of mental processing. It could also have used chapter summaries and/or comprehension questions to ensure you've understood the key points. This was really needed as is chapter was a dense bush of not-well organised collections of concepts and definitions. In short, this needed a more professional/competent writing and editing team before publication. What did I try to gleam from this hunk of words?
Data• Data science is seeking nonobvious and useful findings (actionable insights) from data through pattern extraction. • Common uses: customer segmentation (clustering); association rule mining; anomaly/outlier detection; and classification/prediction.• 3Vs of big data: Volume of data, Variety of data, and Velocity of processing.• Data: numerical, nominal and ordinal; structured and unstructured; and raw data: captured and exhaust data. • DIKW pyramid: Data (abstract elements) preceeds information (linked/structured data), which preceeds knowledge (organised information), which preceeds wisdom (applied knowledge). • CRISP-DM: 6-stage semi-structured cycle with data at its centre: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation and deployment.• Data science ecosystem: data source/ capture applications; data storage (structured or unstructured db); and data processing applications (eg. analytics, back-end, business processes).• OLAP: Online Analytical Processing. A processing system used in data warehouses to generate summaries, and aggregate, slice, dice and pivot the data. Often uses a data cube: fast but rigid fixed dimensional data processing. SQL is often used as a less restrictive alternative. • Hadoop: big data distributed storage and analytics processing. Uses MapReduce based on the split-apply-combine strategy, where each split data chunk is stored on different nodes in a parallel processing cluster. • In-database ML: Avoids moving or formatting the data for ML processing, increasing processing speed and reducing errors. • Alternatives to Hadoop for big-data include: Storm, Spark and Flint. While Hadoop uses data-set batch processing, better suiting summaries of static data, Storm uses individual-item stream processing, better suiting continuous classification tasks. Spark and Flink are hybrids, using both batch and stream processing. Machine Learning• Linear regression: when input attributes are fixed, a regression function's parameters can be estimated using individually weighted averages for each point as they best fit a linear regression function. Often uses least squares for error estimation. • Neural networks: each neuron takes a sum of the weighted inputs and outputs them to an activation function (logistic function or tanh). • Training neural networks uses backpropagation, where the weight-update rule adjusts the weights and error term in each previous neuron. • Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) use feedback loops to remember the context of the previous inputs, often used in NLP.• Convolutional neural networks (CNNs): each set of neurons share their weights to identify a distinct visual feature. The outputs of each layer serve as inputs to the subsequent layer.• Decision trees: best with nominal and ordinal data; uses classification rules based on data attributes to determine labels. Uses a recursive approach, adding nodes as needed, from root to leaf until all labels on the same branch agree. • Concept drift: contrary to the stationarity assumption, behaviours change over time. Models that were previously trained and accurate need to be periodically retrained to adapt. Data Science Tasks• Clustering: sorting data into subgroups, such as customer groups. Eg. k-means clustering.• Anomaly/outlier detection: detection rules for anomylous events (eg. fraud) are checked against data in the data warehouse. Often written in SQL (such as MATCH_RECOGNIZE). Prediction models can also be trained for concurrent detection. Eg. Support-Vector Machines (SVMs) or One-Class Classifier algorithms. • Association-rule mining: unsupervised learning for detecting groups of items that frequently co-occur (eg. Recommendation algorithms and cross-selling systems). Can be used to explore purchase behaviours through correlations of attributes. Eg. Apriori algorithm.• Prediction (classification and regression): exploring the likelihood of future action (such as customer churn or price prediction). Eg. Customer-propensity models.

This book, like many others in those series, help complicated ideas stick by bundling them with a narrative, broad view of a topic. Also they are great because they are shortish.Throughout Data Science you can tell Kelleher and Tierney have applied data science experience in a business setting, rather than just in an academic one. Having both perspectives made for a more engaging read without sacrificing on technical depth.I wasn’t expecting a portion on ethics, but I’m glad they included it to promote best practices.

It is written in an engaging style, and I picked up a number of helpful tools and tricks. My main points of criticism would be that there are no exercises to test one's understanding of the tools/techniques that were introduced in the chapter and that it (too often for my liking) uses some pretty sophisticated wrapper scripts by the author himself, which obscure things more than they help. I would have preferred learning how to get along with just ""standard"" tools that don't require an installation of some Go or R runtime on top of some github cloning and building.

267,"I'm still struggling to find the book I want around data science. I've learned that there are two levels:1. KNOWING data science2. DOING data scienceThis book is about the second one. Make no mistake, this is a ""statistical computation"" manual. This shows you how to find statistical answers using Python. Fully half this book is code samples. If you do not plan to actually attempt to find statistical answers to known questions by writing Python code, then this isn't the book for you.I would look at the code samples in this book and think, ""What am I supposed to do with this? I'll take the author's word for it that this works, but what is it supposed to tell me?"" The code samples don't even show much inner computation, since most of the work is rolled up into Python libraries, and the code samples really just show magical method calls and the code around those. This is damn-near a Python manual.And I disagree with the title: ""...from Scratch."" It's not from scratch, and this is my major complaint: knowing how to find the answer is the second half of the process. The major problem is this: no one knows the right questions. I can find or hire someone to give me the answer. Explain to me what questions I should be asking of data.And this is where the book falls down. The scenarios described are enormously contrived, and they're glossed over in a mad rush to get to the code samples (the very part I didn't care about). I want more time spent on why the question matters. Real world examples would be nice too.I get that this might not be what the author was going for. But I fault him for the title. It's not ""Data Science from Scratch."" It's, ""How To Compute Statistics with Python."" I guess I should have paid more attention to the subtitle.So, this is my problem with this book, and with about every book I've read on data science in the last two years. All these books are written by statisticians who are very quick to show you math (or code). I want a book written by a business person that starts with the idea of what solutions we can unlock from our data.How to find those solutions?

If they do (and here I'm ignoring the fact that why would they, since the title of the book is ""data science from scratch""), then they will find the explanations of concepts too basic, and the Python code implementation examples mostly useless (they, after all, are not using the libraries specifically designed to do data science, but rather implementing a naïve direct approach). And if they don't, then they will find the explanations of concepts too skimpy to be useful, with the Python code implementation examples still useless, because a) they are hard to follow without first understanding the concepts, and b) they are ""from scratch"", so you wouldn't even be able to re-use them in production for the concepts you did understand. In all, my biggest gripe is that the book covers not the ""data science from scratch"", as advertised, but rather ""Python code implementation from scratch, as it applies to poorly explained data science concepts"".

272,"This is not a stand-alone book. It won't show you how to solve real problems with code, as it doesn't use any actual library. And it won't teach you the theory and mathematics of data science (the explanations of the models are very synthetic, often frustratingly so). Rather, the book lives in a limbo between theory and practice. The old saying goes, you haven't understood something until you can explain it to your grandmother. Then again, whoever came up with that saying probably never tried explaining backpropagation to her. If you lack a mathematically oriented grandma, the Python interpreter is a good substitute. Working through this book, I feel that I have learned and consolidated many new concepts. However, I skipped several chapters which were quite compressed and hurried. For example, the chapter on Neural Networks is only 17 Kindle pages long. It introduces perceptrons, feed-forward, backpropagation, and a neural network coded from scratch, which the author applies to learning the fizzbuzz challenge. The average reader will experience a lot of frustration here; which is not necessarily an evil thing. As promised, the author builds almost everything from scratch, so his code style gets to shine. I found his code to be elegant and pythonic, generally a joy to read, and maybe that's my greatest takeaway (though the emphasis on typing can get annoying, especially when it involves importing types or creating new objects).Skimming through other reviews, I notice a general misunderstanding about the target of this book - of which I partly was a victim myself. The phrase ""from scratch"" implies a basic and easy approach, which would be suitable for beginners. Of course, in data science the basic approach is precisely the opposite, i.e. playing with the libraries without fully understanding how they work. To start building algorithms from scratch, you need to either be quite decent at mathematics, or to have played enough with software that you have built some mental models (or notional machines) about ""how this stuff works"".

Хорошего, понятного, компактного кода (пользуясь питоном время от времени не первый год, не думал что этот язык может быть таким элегантным). Во-первых, это позволяет сэкономить место – хорошо написанный код лучше описания алгоритмов человечим языком, во-вторых, такая реализация с нуля дает более глубокое понимание того, что творится внутри библиотек, реализующих тот же функционал. В конце каждой главы есть раздел ""куда смотреть дальше"", где даются дельные советы, какие библиотеки, инструменты и материалы помогут вам развиться в заданном направлении.

284,"Quick read. And a great intro that brushes over the area of Data Science. Even though it does not convey much knowledge that could be used by a practicing Data Scientist. The ""from Scratch"" part of the title refers to the book's focus on the implementation of the popular algorithms using Python. From scratch. Which is... rather pointless. Anyone serious about Data Science would use pre-packaged, efficient libraries to train their models instead. The author does send the reader to external sources with the actual Data Science tools. I just wished the author spent more time on them.It is interesting to see that many seemingly complicated Machine Learning algorithms could be implemented in Python. However, I wouldn't say that seeing such implementation contributed to a better understanding of them.Read the book if you want to have a quick overview of some of the tools available in the industry.

Good book for those starting out, but didn't have much to offer on the statistical learning side, principles and concepts wise. You're better off looking at books such as IPSUR (Jay G Kearns) and ISLR (Hastie & Tibshirani) for such content. However, this is a practical book because it introduces many relevant ideas.

I so wanted to fall in love with this book, but I didn't. Why?1. The author really wanted to show as much Data Science goodness as possible. Unfortunately, as a result, the whole book feels like a roller-coaster or US tourists' trip across Europe (""10 capital cities in 2 weeks""). Zillion topics, but each of them covered in a rush, w/o setting proper foundations. Don't get me wrong, he does keep the proper structure - the chapters do have introductions, but after a good start (initial 2 pages of general context), he dives super deep into Python code ...2. SageMaker is not a trivial service. There are some unobvious conceptual constructs that require careful elaboration. It's hard to navigate across such a complex service w/o a proper overview, possibly some examples that approach it from very different angles. Or a real-life study across the whole model's lifecycle. I think that's what is totally missing in official AWS docs and ... unfortunately, it's also what's missing in the book. YES, there are very specific code samples that I assume are correct and solve a narrow, particular problem. But does reading through them make the reader able to compose a solution to another (even similar) problem? I don't think so ...3. I was wondering - who could be the best audience for this book. And I have a surprising conclusion: probably people who already know the SageMaker basics, who have used it in a single scenario or two. This book 'drafts' briefly so many scenarios that can spur their imagination (regarding what's possible in AWS when it comes to AI/ML) and they already have enough understanding of concepts behind the service to take it from here.It really saddens me to rate this book so harshly, especially because it's very visible how much effort was put into it.

The authors crammed a lot of examples and workflows in, trying to showcase all the various offerings in the SageMaker ecosystem and lots of special cases, but seem to lose track a bit of bringing more general messages across. It could be helpful to reorganize some of the insights from this book around user stories, trying to prove how sub-components of the product can be of value even before a massive effort has been made to adapt to the entire ecosystem.

While this is technically true because of a couple of projects using simulated data, really there is a single dataset used throughout the book. Also, the index needs to be beefed up quite a bit (e.g., where is ROC?).So why did I give the book 5 stars? The author spends 300+ pages analyzing the data, which consists of features related to default payment history. The machine learning methods he uses consist primarily of logistic regression and decision trees (including random forests).Along the way he introduces a large variety of relevant topics, including statistical tests (e.g., F-test, tests of normality and correlation) and how to deal with missing values. Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are used for processing the data and he doesn't assume you are already familiar with how to use these libraries. He also teaches some more theoretical topics, such as gradient descent for learning the parameters in the logistic regression model.While various other books on Data Science cover some of the previously mentioned topics, what really sets this book apart from most of those other books is the depth in which he covers those topics as well as his thought process behind what he chooses to do and how to interpret the results.

After discussing data scaling/normalization, it presents methods to perform dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis. It finally describes numerical encoding of labels and one-hot encoding.Chapter 5 treats iterative learning via gradient descent and minimization of various loss functions.It then turns to unsupervised learning (k-means and DBSCAN) and supervised learning (Naive Bayes and neural networks).

He said he had been… was… dad’s friend. He asked Orrin if his dad showed him his trick of moving something without his hands. Orrin said yes, and the man asked him to show him. When Orrin took off his shoes and used his toes to physically move the little ball, the man smiled and sank to the floor with his hands on his face. Then his mom found them, said something to Jim, and put Orrin’s shoes back on his feet. She yelled at Jim again about Charlie, Orrin’s dad, being dead, and Orrin knew that word. When “dead” happened to Grandma Becca, it meant she didn’t come back…Drew Hicks was studying Orrin Grimm’s info when the CEO’s son, Ivan, teased him about looking for a boyfriend. Drew explained that Orrin applied for the biometric statistical analysis position, but Doctor DuMarque sent his résumé to Drew because he thought Orrin would be perfect for their project. Ivan got serious and said Drew would really want Orrin on the project team whether Orrin was interested or not! But he didn’t explain. When Drew saw Dr. DuMarque, he was told Grimm was now his direct subordinate and the two of them were the entire department for now, the other candidates already dismissed. With magic talents starting to reappear and in unexpected ways, Drew and Orrin’s work will be invaluable. But they will need to track down these instances rather than rely on self-reporting of the magic showing up, at least to determine if it is just urban legend or really occurred as if something had changed. Drew and Orrin would travel to the people for their research. Lines of magic reemerging without a traceable link back to the lab would not make them look good. And magic not following family lines was disturbing.But when Orrin’s own routine lab tests came back showing anomalies, meaning he was Enhanced, he is put in an awkward situation! With his new job partnered with Drew Hicks, tracking down other undocumented Enhanced, will Orrin be risking losing the beginning attraction between himself and Drew? And is it right to forcefully expose other Enhanced who would prefer to remain hidden?This is a very intriguing story, well-written and easy to read despite some of the jargon thrown in.

Brunton and Kutz build their way up from fundamental techniques of linear algebra, through almost every major aspect of classical control, to some of the cutting edge techniques of modern control (like SINDy which they've helped develop). And yet, though it touches on so many complex ideas, they manage to write in simple, understandable english. They center almost every new idea in examples or illustrations help illustrate the real-world meaning. And their explanations are written with such lucidity that concepts I had to prove to myself in grad school (like projecting functions into different bases) seem almost self-evident. I've used several system identification techniques they present (like Dynamic Mode Decomposition) to solve problems at work, and I see several more opportunities for direct applications of the stuff they discuss here.

352,"This is NOT a complete data science cookbook or a machine learning textbook. It's a collection of lecture material from an introductory survey class taught last year at Columbia University. The derivations of equations can be head-scratchingly brief. (And I was a math major.) However, each chapter ends with a bibliography of what to read next and why.I agree with the description that this is a ""holistic and humanist approach to data science."" The field of data science is in a state of flux and the authors make their plea for how to define the field more broadly. Yes, there is a whole lot of data crunching. But, they also want practitioners to step back and think carefully about the goals and implications of all that data crunching.Reading the book is not enough. I look forward to downloading the data and code from the laboratory portion of the class from their website and playing around.This is a good first book for those who like to get their hands dirty and muck around with data.

353,"Not recommended at all. If the authors do not put much time into a book, neither should the reader.Rachel Schutt and Cathy O'Neil put together a book with an ambitious title about the emerging field of data science. They cover a broad ground spanning some basic statistics, machine learning, data acquisition, cleaning and visualization and finally also the ethics and sociology of this field.That sounds great doesn't it?Except - this is the single laziest book I have ever read. The book is essentially hastily put together blogs (originally appeared - and freely available on O'Neil's blog) on Rachel Schutt's data science classes (most of the classes were actually prepared by miscellaneous people from the data science business). All material is covered very superficially - while large chunks are devoted to machine learning there is no chance you could learn anything from it since there is not much system to the material and the coverage is largely theoretical and wonder-your-arms-don't-fall-off hand-wavy. Machine Learning in Action is Summa Theologica compared to this. It is not supposed to be a machine learning textbook? All right, it sure isn't. But it is not much else either.I follow Cathy O'Neil's blog so the ethics/sociology stuff was not new for me (again - do not expect them to put any extra effort to the book). And let us not be mistaken for a moment - this is still far from a thought-through critique of the field - just a bunch of blog snippets pasted together.Top it of with a self-congratulatory chapter of essay's by the students that participated in the course (way to go to fill more pages with no content that you don't even have to write yourself!).Cathy O'Neil once explained her high efficiency by saying that e.g. when preparing a 40 minute talk she will devote to it max. 20 minutes of work. If they write a book you read in 5 hours they probably spent full 2 hours writing it...It is unfortunate. The true high gain in efficiency comes from providing good content to your audience that goes on to create great things from it. Spend 8 hours on your 40 minute talk if the 50 people in the audience go on to do great stuff with it.... Or spend 20 minutes just to waste 51 x 40 minutes of time...

354,"Pretty cool introductory course over all the things ""data science"" does nowadays, i.e., mostly data cleaning, machine learning, prediction etc. It's good to see that the authors spend so much time talking about the pitfalls of dirty data, how important it is to be skeptical of the model's output, overfitting, correlation != causation and much more; much stuff I've read so far just focuses on how the model is used, not how the model is interpreted.This book will certainly not turn you into a data scientists, but it will a) give you starting points for most common tasks (in other words, when someone will ask you for a fairly robust classification method, you might think of random forests or k-NN after this book). Plus, it gives you lots of books for each of the sub-fields to further your studies.My biggest annoyance is the constant love for Google, like every 50 pages or so Google is mentioned and how great it is to work there, and how fun it is to work on Google+ etc. pp.Things you need to know before reading: - Math: you should know what the common symbols like Sigma means, and be able to solve some equations- How to read programs: Most of the book's code is in R, with a bit of Python, and 4 or 5 lines of Go.

356,"“Data Science” has become one of the most trendy research fields in recent years, as well as a catchall rubric for various job descriptions and work functions. The cynics and skeptics, and there are many of those, contend that “Data Science” is nothing more than repackaged Statistics, with a bit of coding and hacking thrown in. Its proponents, however, point out that most practicing data scientists use a variety of skills and techniques in their daily work, and come from a vast spectrum of career paths and backgrounds. I tend to side with the latter group, but I too am an outsider to this field and am still trying to get a better understanding of what it really entails. “Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline” is a compendium of chapters that deal with data science as it is practiced in the real world. Each chapter is written by a different author, all of who have significant practical experience and are acknowledged authorities on data science. Most of the contributors work in industry, but data science is still so fresh and new that there is a lot of crossing over between academia and the corporate world. A few of the chapters include exercises, but these tend to be too advanced and assume too much background material for an introductory book. The exercises still give you a good idea of what kinds of problems data scientists tend to grapple with. However, this book is definitely not a textbook and cannot be effectively used as such. The book doesn’t provide any background on R, statistics, data scrubbing, machine learning, and various other techniques used by data scientist. It is highly unlikely that any single textbook would be able to do justice to all of that material anyways, but a book of that sort could still have a lot of potential use.There are two groups of people who would benefit from this book. The first are people who have absolutely no background in data science or any of its related fields, but would like to get a flavor of what data science is all about and are interested in exploring it for career purposes. The second group are people with significant technical background in one of the fields related to data science (programming, statistics, machine learning, etc.) who are interested in broadening their skills and would like to see how would their particular strengths fit within the broader data science field.

357,"Computer applications have become increasingly pervasive, collecting vast quantities of data relating to many diverse activities. Advances in computer hardware have provided solutions that enable this data to be collected and stored, and data owners expect that important and possibly commercially advantageous information is contained within these data sets.Data science is an emerging discipline that, while not yet having a strict and common definition, broadly relates to the preparation and exploration of typically large data sets in order to identify patterns, predict outcomes, classify and derive meaning using a variety of mathematical and software tools.This book, which is based on a course developed and delivered by the authors at Columbia University, is a practical introduction to data science and explores the subject from a variety of theoretical, application-specific and professional perspectives.Introductory chapters set the scene by exploring the question ‘what is data science?’, outlining the data science landscape and the role and skillset of a data scientist.The authors then examine general features of data sources, including the kinds of statistical limitations that can be present in data sets, and outline a data science process that defines a practical, general approach to data science projects. Methods of exploratory data analysis and data modelling are described and supported by practical exercises, which also introduce the reader to the R language.As might be expected, a significant part of the book is devoted the discussion of common probabilistic and statistical approaches used in solving classification and prediction problems, along with discussion of the suitability of different algorithms for different scenarios, how models can be fitted to data sets and ways in which algorithms and models can be evaluated. The book also outlines the principles and use cases of the map/reduce approach.In addition to data analysis techniques, the book contains introductions to general data science applications, including recommendation systems, data visualisation and approaches to deriving meaning and causality.As well as general data science topics, the authors also consider application-specific topics in data science. These chapters consider the differing features and analytical requirements of data sets such as social network data, epidemiological data and time-stamped financial data.Many chapters include additional content from subject matter experts who describe the ways in which the techniques discussed in the book are being applied to solve real problems.This book covers a lot of ground and contains many links to other sources. Where applicable, the content is supplemented by practical examples, using tools such as R, bash and Python, and the authors have provided downloadable data sets for readers to explore.The text is well written, with an authoritative but engaging informal style. However, it is worth noting that some chapters require the reader to have a reasonable mathematical background, including linear algebra. There is great emphasis on practical application of the content, supported by advice based on the authors’ own experiences. The book is a good introduction to the emerging field of data science, which encourages readers to delve deeper into the subject.Reviewed by Patrick Hill CEng MBCS CITP FIAP MIEEE ", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17346997/reviews

The level of detail in this book ranges too oddly to be generally useful; the authors (PhDs in math and stats) switch from colloquial discussion of some topics to a highly mathematical explanation of a very specific data problem that they explored in their personal careers, for example, and tend to give off the impression that one needs to understand everything that a math PhD understands in order to be able to use the techniques they cover (one doesn't).

For this style of reading, it holds up well: the chapters are discreet packets of data science chat. That said, I agree with other critiques of this book: if you're an aspiring data scientist, this book is NOT sufficient to get you off the ground. It's not a good beginner's book. It's maybe a good ""pop data science"" book, a pre-beginner's book. It's very light on the technical stuff, and, if anything, it's more like an anthropological survey of the state of the field.Each chapter covers a technique or common challenge or strategy, describes the general jist of what's going on, and then points you in the direction of papers, other books, or tutorials online. Early chapters have some ""exercises"", though they're more like general pointers of ""oh, you could try this, I guess?"" Later chapters don't even bother. For an O'Reilly book, I was disappointed that the GitHub repo didn't have, for example, the code examples mentioned in the book, or the exercises and toy datasets. (What? Are we supposed to manually copy down several pages of R code?!) Or even just a README.md with a bibliography (given how many shortened Google links are used as citations)? This makes it a starkly UNFRIENDLY book, which is weird since O'Reilly books (well, the good ones) can be very, very rich resources. This, instead, felt thin - and the repo is basically pointless. I *will* say that I enjoyed the banter-y tone of the book, and some of the discussions of techniques (e.g. there was a great, intuitive explanation of Principal Component Analysis) and ""real world"" issues (e.g. how Kaggle competitions are basically data science in a vacuum; what it's like to be a lady data scientist) were quite good.

Denn es gibt weder Konsensus noch eine offizielle Definition. Allerdings handelt es sich um ein sehr sexy Thema zur Zeit und fast jeder Verlag hat mittlerweile ein Buch diesbezüglich im Angebot; O'reilly macht es nicht anders.Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline versucht, eine Einführung zum Thema zu sein, ohne eine große Mathematik-Theorie dahinter. Vielmehr will von dem Alltag von Data Scientists erzählen und ein Basisverständnis für Data Science schaffen.Die Autorinnen sind bekannt in der Szene: Cathy O'Neill, ist eine bekannte Bloggerin (mathbabe) mit einem sehr starken mathematischen Hintergrund, und Rachel Schutt lehrt an der Columbia University in New York. All dies sind die richtigen Bedingungen für ein gutes Buch über das Thema: Erfahrene Expertinnen, die sich sehr gut schriftlich ausdrücken können und im Data Science tätig sind.Allerdings liegt hier genau das Problem, dass Buch ist weder ein Fachbuch noch ein Roman. Es fühlt sich genau wie eine Sammlung von Blog-Einträgen oder einen längeren Magazinartikel. Denn einige Kapitel sind Gastbeiträge von anderen Experten oder Studenten des erwähnten Kurses. Noch dazu ist das Buch an sich eine Ansammlung von Präsentationen und Vorträgen der Data Science Vorlesung an der Columbia University. Somit ist das Stil in jedem Kapitel etwas anders. Außerdem sind viele Sachen im Buch leider entweder extrem oberflächig erklärt oder sogar falsch.Es ist sehr schade, da das Buch extrem viel Potential hat. Trotzdem ist Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline generell ein positiver Beitrag. Jeder kann die Themen verstehen, es ist unterhaltsam und die Literaturempfehlungen sind sehr umfassend.

377,"Doing Data Science is about the practice of data science, not its implementation. It is based on a course on data science that featured a guest lecturer on each topic. This leads to the guest lecturers (and chapters) focusing more on important concepts rather then the methodology. So, this is not a textbook or a how-to-do-this type of book, rather it is a how-to-think-when-doing book.A problem with books like this where each chapter is written by someone different is the need for coherence. A second is that each author typically has something to day, and she has to say it in her chapter. So, compared to other data science books, it suffers from the chapters not building on each other in a systematic way and having multiple messages that appear as you go through the book.One benefit from this is that each author has something to say. While I find the book thin on how to do things, this is a good source of wisdom in why things are done and issues that come up along the way in real life. I am teaching data science for the first time and I find myself turning here for topics of discussion which my chosen textbooks don't cover (as they have more focus on how to do things).I don't think this is the book to use to learn how to do data science, and I suspect the students at Columbia learned how to find other sources to help them figure things out. But it provides wisdom, which is harder to find and worth quite a bit.Note: I received a free electronic copy of this book from the publisher as par of the OReilly Bloggers program.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17346997/reviews
378,"I agree with one of the earlier reviewers that this feels like a lazily written book. The book reads like too much like its source - an editorialized set of lectures. In various turns, the writing shifts from attempting to impress with mathematical derivations that are too cursory to be of help to those without working knowledge of the area of math to touting how great tool x or method y is to do some data analysis task. It also far too often feels like the authors are more interested in throwing around how many different techniques they have used or know about and show very little interest in engaging in the deeper thinking about why certain analyses should be done or what value there is to gain out of different types of analyses. Having read the ebook version, the book also relies heavily on links to other articles and documents that are not helpful in the flow of reading. And finally, its very hard to take a book seriously when the authors feel the need to use informal language to speak to the reader. Silly personal asides should be left for personal correspondence or moments of levity in the classroom lectures; they don't add anything to book seeking to give a professional view of data science.In the end, the book is not helpful as a survey of technical tools and methods, nor is it helpful as a general approach to doing and thinking about data science. Better books exist for both purposes and this book fails to provide much value for either purpose.", 2 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17346997/reviews
379,"What is all the clamor about data science? What even is data science? Rachel Schutt addresses these questions in the introductory chapter of Doing Data Science. As a data padawan, naive and idealistic, I came to this book with the expectation that it would give me the prestidigitation of a powerful sorcerer. Needless to say, the book disappointed in that aspect. Turns out I'm going to have to sidle up to my computer and math books for 10,000 hours before I can do anything magical. Nonetheless, this book is an excellent introduction to the concept of data science and should be a go-to resource for anyone interested in learning more about the subject. The book is a compendium of lectures by figures in the data science community about different aspects of the field. Each of these lectures gives a broad overview of a subject. Math competency is recommended but not required to get the gist of most of the chapters. ", 3 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17346997/reviews

I liked it because it is like real life is - sometimes inconsistent and demanding. After reading this book you understand that you don't understand bunch of things. It is not like some usual articles/books about data science and showing only it's glory. It showed what are pitfalls in data science and how f****** hard it can be to get practical value from it. I liked that book discussed many themes and gave code examples and exercises which really put you into thinking. Books that are written by people who are practitioners are usually exciting to read. Only minus with this book is that some of code samples are old and some of the datasets which book refers could not be found on internet anymore.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17346997/reviews
381,"Comprehensive intro on ""What is data science?"". It is nice that the book is not fully technical but it also analyze the hype around the field, its deep connections to math, statistics and computer science. Interesting that in each chapter, the book presents one or two data science people from industry and how they use described methods in their work. The way machine learning methods are described formally could have been better, it is hard to follow the math/notation the book follows. Also, the level of detail is not consistent (or monotonically increasing) through the book. The R/python/bash code snippets are nice and useful to have for reference.","el=""Review ",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17346997/reviews
382,"I bought this book along with 14 other books in an online ""bundle"" sale, and this is the one I picked to read first.This is a good statistics and ML handbook. You won't find full-length proofs or detailed intuitions/explanations. And that is hardly to be expected; the official documentation for many of the algorithms presented here would each cover half a book this size.Why I think this is a useful book is that it structures and packs everything in this vast domain of knowledge into bite-sized pieces for you to consume when you need a memory-refresher/quick-reference. The way it achieves this is by covering key terms, basic ideas of concepts, important implementation considerations, along with R code snippets (I was told that there is a second edition out now, with Python code).It would've been even better if the book had a ""Part 2"" dealing with neural networks and deep learning.P.S.

I do not think this book is suited for data scientists who are very likely to be already very familiar with all the notions covered in the book. This book is more like a short introduction to data science. If you already have some applied mathematics / statistics background skip this book. Otherwise, you will find yourself skimming through the book. I will not go in this book for further references since the topics are not especially well explained nor they are tackled in-depth.

386,"This book is well written and packs a substantial amount of information into a small number of pages. It is best used to get a survey and overview of many of the facets of the domain of data science. This book will not teach you anything in enough depth to actually execute it well — it will teach you just enough to be dangerous and not realize when you've gone off the rails. I recommend it for managers who may never go into technical depth, for people considering whether or not they are interested in data science, or as a preview book to create a framework from which to hang more detailed understanding. Although this is an introductory book, it assumes you can already program in R. If you can't, either accept that you won't be able to follow the specifics of the examples, or read The Art of R Programming and/or R for Data Science.I dislike that the authors make a number of categorical statements of the form ""Data Scientists do this"" or ""Data Scientists don't need that"". I disagree with many of these assertions and I think they have taken a definition of ""data science"" which is narrower than the prevailing consensus in the industry.This book has some errors (see, for example, the confusion matrix on page 196) but overall the accuracy is acceptable relative to recent norms.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40796298/reviews

True Story.This book is, by all measures, a veritable jewel in the body of literature for a field that has been long suffering from lazy exposition, unoriginal approaches, shallow techniques, and bloated texts.Does the author resort to using the same tired benchmark datasets to carry out his analyses? Nope. He not only provides you with a completely novel, realistic, simulated social network dataset, but he also provides all of the code, schemas, wrappers, etc... so you can create these on your own to follow along, or adapt them to your own production use-cases. This alone is worth many times the price of the text.Chapter One alone is by far the best opening chapter in any data science text available to date, and trust me, I read a lot of them... If you are not convinced by the time you are done with this chapter, then by all means, stop here and go no further.The techniques go from the very basic to the advanced: data analysis, metric creation/feature engineering, loading matrices, dataset creation, variable grouping, cohort analysis, forecasting, and more. So while you think you're just reading a book on ""churn analysis"", you're getting much more. It is essentially, a textbook on data science techniques and best practices applied to churn events. Substitute churn with some other event, and you can pretty much extend the ideas in here to just about any use-case you'll come across. It's 24K Gold. I can't applaud the author enough for his intellectual generosity in capturing, synthesizing, and sharing his decades of experience on this field for the benefit of the rest of us.

More importantly, it helps develop a more tolerant attitude towards singular events, or a series of them which can sometimes span through the better part of a season!The author also shows why football's complexity makes it extremely hard for a Moneyball-like model to dominate to the level that it does in other major sports.The author's range of experiences with people from different backgrounds and tiers of the leagues is impressive. I particularly enjoyed the author throwing light on the entrepreneurial efforts of these people along with their technical approaches.

They didn't win because ""they wanted it more"" or they were ""in form""What really matters is the data: the dangerousity, the npxG, the Pressure Passing Efficiency Index. Of course, there's a tremendous amount of sheer luck involved. But Biermann tells accounts of hundreds of people who attempt to situate football analytics away from fate. The end-product is a cold efficient model that dives deeper into the game, free from cognitive biases and kismet.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45029227/reviews
447," Thoroughly enjoyable and insightful read. I thought it would be a book “just” on statistics in football, but it was so much more. As all data and statistical analysis should be, it was contextualised alongside the modern history of this growing aspect of the game, and struck a balance between the traditional approach to analysis in football, and the more modern advanced statistical analysis. Written by someone who clearly loves the game, and wants to know more about it - and I’d highly recommend the book to anyone who identifies as such.

449,"First off, the book is pretty poorly edited."" There are a bunch of annoying grammar mistakes (simple things every now and then like substituting “that” for “which) and redundancies throughout the text (I am not sure how much of this is down to the translation from English to German). Some thoughts that don’t really get wrapped up properly and the subject tends to jump around occasionally. He sometimes gets off on tangents and un-needed details which can cause you forget the subject of the chapter. It's not that the side topics he discusses are bad, they would just be better utilized as footnotes so they don't fill up several paragraphs and cause the topic of the chapter to appear somewhat disjointed. Because of this, the anecdotal portions suffer a little bit. But if you can push past these errors there is a LOT of good and useful stuff to be found. The book does a good job of making use of Danny Kahnemann and Amos Tversky’s work into decision theory and heuristics & biases (I got all excited when the author mentioned them because I had just barely finished the Undoing Project). He makes soccer stats very approachable and easy to grasp. He also explains how every metric for judging performance can be put into practical application. Its filled with tons of graphs and data sets (as you would expect). Aside from the main focus of the book - the more recent innovations in soccer data analytics (xG plots, spatial tracking, xGA, xA, PPDA, etc.) - there is not a whole lot that will be new to you if you have already read something like soccernomics.

Biermann also affords us to views charts and tables to compare different metrics for players across the big leagues in Europe and there is a bigger focus on his native Germany.Biermann is open minded enough not to foist opinions on what he presenting and let us decide if things make sense or are applicable to the game. It would seem at this point in time there isn’t a clear Moneyball stat that’ll let teams play the game in a more efficient way overall, but there are likelihoods attached with every action which will correspond with the xG and other similar stats. The biggest thing appears to be with transfers completed utilising data with Brighton an early adopter of the strategy exemplified by their signing of Pascal Gross in the book.There is plenty of crossover between the two books as they explore what is somewhat of an outsider community even as the prevalent data departments crop up in every major football club around the world.

461,"For anyone, like me, who thought that analytics and football do not mix well, this book is really an eye opener. Not only do they blend well but also achieve good results. The book presents some new metrics devised to analyze player and club performance. The initial goal was simply to help with odds and betting but, afterwards, some clubs started to embrace a data-driven approach to have answers for questions like: How to choose a new player for your club? We have lost 3 games in a row. Are we that bad or simply out of luck? Are we really efficient when we have ball possession? As football is a very conservative (and gut based) sport, it is difficult to push for an analytical approach as told by some of the stories in the book.

462,"These are the things I learnt from this book or strated to think about:How do you rate football players on their performances? As Biermann demonstrates journalists (professional football ones) differ in their judgements from 2 to 5 during one single game.How would that then work in refereeing - how do you really make a difference between a good referee and a great one as subjective feelings are always misleading.Why really good teams go through bad patches even if they are not playing that badly?Or why then some good referees go though bad games and decisions?Is there a fairer way to measure the quality of a team performances over the result or standard things like possession and attempts of goal. Something like Expected Points or Expected Goals?To be successful you have two ways to go about it - either be the best in the business in whatever field you are in or try to solve the issue from a completely different angle. Like in high-jumping Dick Fosbury reverted to the now universally used ""flop"" style. The biggest change in football and how it is understood and interpreted has come from the rise of video analyses. Firstly it has enabled brilliant coaches like Guardiola or Van Gaal or Tuchel or Klopp to study extensive videos on their oppositions and their own team performances to come up with new ways of succeeding. It has also enabled them to learn from other coaches and derive how successful their methods are. Secondly they now have material to show the players exactly what they want them to see and explain their methods. Gone are the days when ""tactical training"" required tedious sit-throughs of whole games. With the help of video analysts this has now been cut significantly to only those moments that matter.FC Bayerns Head of Department of Match Analysis (8 people) Michael Niemeyer says: ""For me a good coach is also a good analyst""It is fascinating though that if in 2010 when video analyses and big data really went widespread - the world of soccer statistics seemed to be the future. However today still the big leap into big data and statistics has not happened. There are a few teams making use of it (like FC Midtjylland in Denmark as one example.), but generally football looks at it with suspicion. One of the problems of football data has been its non-uniformity. Numbers are gathered but not in the same way and not measuring the same exact things - thus they are not always reliable. Or you can look at statistics from a match (Like Brazil vs. Germany in 2014 WC semi-final 1-7) and see that Brazil won all of the statistical battles like possession, shots, tackles, corners, dangerous attacks and still suffered the heaviest defeat in the WC semi-finals ever.In short the answer to using statistics then is to collect even more data, and try to analyze it from others aspects and from different angles. Come up with models that really demonstrate effectiveness on the field of play. ""Packing"" is one such possible metric. For example in the EURO2016 34 of 51 games were won by teams who had bypassed more players (essence of packing) than the opponents and only 3 teams lost and there is a much stronger correlation between packing and winning than between possession or passing stats. Another similar metric is ""controlling space"" (how much space you have around you when you receive the ball and how much space you allow your opposition when they get the ball) and ""dangerousity"" (how much danger did a team create and how much were they exposed to).As computers learn they will do all the measuring work and provide data which then can be interpreted and analyzed and put to use by clubs and coaches.One field in football that already today heavily relies on data is scouting and the best scouts (using the best systems) are heavily sought after like Sven Mislintnat (from Borussia to Arsenal).Cognitive footballHoffenheim coach Nagelsmann makes his training sessions so complicated that his sports psychologist Jan Mayer says about the players ""We want their head to spin during training"" - and you only learn when your brain has to work hard.Sandro Wagner on Nagelsmann ""He takes a complicated game, takes it apart into different sections, rehearses those and then puts it all back together, step by step""Together with SAP Hoffenheim have created game apps that aim to improve perception, understanding and decision-making for the players. Some players like goalkeepers come in twice a week, youth team once a week, outfield players when they want to.Another really interesting trend (used by Midtjylland and Tuchel for example) is psychological profiling of players and how different players work together. So that your team needs a balanced amount of fighters, artists, engineers and social workers on the field (similar to Belbin).Future strategiesReally interesting idea is that of Ghosting - a game is played and based on the data feed into the computer previously - the computer offers an ideal route for the player to take in that situation. So for a defender to either close down the opposition or stay put on the 16m area line. And you can see live the difference between the two. Same can be applied to refereeing if we know from which positions referees make the best calls - so with ghosting we could teach referees where to position.It is clear however that the more detailed the analyses gets, the more expensive it gets and the danger is that the top clubs (Liverpool, Bayern etc) buy the systems and work with them behind closed doors so taking them out of the public domain. Could that happen in refereeing so that the smaller countries will stay more behind the leading ones?", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45029227/reviews
463,"Es un poco extraño que este libro de Christoph Biermann llamara mi atención cuando me topé con el en la sección de remates de mi librería local. No soy, ni por accidente, un aficionado del fútbol. Los goles no me inspiran ninguna sensación sublime ni tampoco me apasiona discutir las mejores estrategias en la cancha, por lo que suelo esquivar las grandes polémicas del balón, como la reciente decisión del árbitro en el partido entre Perú y Uruguay en Montevideo.Sobre tecnologías de información, análisis de probabilidad y la 'revolución de la data', como la llama Biermann en este libro, tampoco estaba muy enterado. Quizá fue esa doble ignorancia la que me atrajo a la posibilidad de introducirme en ambos temas a través de una crónica de las profundas transformaciones que ocurren en el paisaje deportivo en los últimos quinquenios. Este libro es un relato de un experimentado periodista sobre el advenimiento y proliferación de variopintas métricas y modelos estadísticos para hacer otorgar sentido a sets de datos y lograr predecir resultados con un poquito más de certeza frente a la ""eterna predisposición del fútbol a los eventos aleatorios"" (p. 187) A lo largo del libro el autor se entrevista con varios de los protagonistas de esta revolución, llevándonos alternadamente por famosos estadios, canchas de clubs de segunda división y salas de conferencias de startups en Alemania, Inglaterra y los EEUU para presentarnos a una serie de iluminados personajes. Asi conocemos las historias de innovadores DTs y outsiders --entre académicos advenedizos, blogueros aficionados y exiliados de otros deportes más matematizados como el basket y la Fórmula 1-- dispuestos a acabar con los sesgos cognitivos que dominan las discusiones, y no pocas veces, decisiones futbolísticas.Aunque la informacion sobre victorias y derrotas, goles acumulados, pases exitosos, tiros atajados y tiempo de posesión de pelota nunca ha sido escasa, la tabulación de estos datos no ha sido siempre esclarecedora. Hasta ahora. Contra las falaces expectativas de que un equipo ganador necesariamente repetirá el éxito con facilidad, Biermann contrapone la percepción del fútbol como un deporte ""parecido al ajedrez pero con dados"" (p. 46). ¿Cómo entender, entonces, el azar? Apertrechados con sensores corporales, múltiples cámaras a lo largo de la cancha y software de análisis espacial, los nuevos ""hackers"" tratan de dar vuelta a la incertidumbre con modelos que le otorgan nuevo sentido a la data acumulada. Así, métricas como el ""Peligro Esperado"" u ""Oportunidades Creadas"" cruzan varias fuentes de información para producir cifras que permiten cuantificar y comparar dimensiones del juego que antes podían resultas imperceptibles o confundidas en un vago sentido de suerte o incluso destino.La métrica que más aparece en el libro es una que no sé como traducir. ""Packing"", inventada por el ex-jugador Stefan Reinartz es un buen ejemplo de como la data está transformando el deporte. Segun explica Biermann, packing mide la calidad de un pase a partir del número de oponentes gambeteados por un jugador determinado. Biermann nos cuenta la historia de sus origenes, así como su popularización tras ser adoptada por un popular comentarista televisivo. Al extenderse más allá de los camerines de los técnicos deportivos, las métricas han transformado no solo la estrategia de los equipos, sino también la manera en que se discute el juego entre aficionados y tahúres profesionales.Como lección de sus observaciones y entrevistas en el campo, Biermann concluye que la data, ya sea cruda o cocida mediante estadísticos que condensan en cifras objetivas diversos aspectos del juego, no es suficiente para tomar decisiones correctas ni para juzgar con justicia a un equipo o jugador individual. Se necesita siempre del contexto para su correcta interpretacion (p. 166) y, mas que números mágicos que desentrañen el secreto final del éxito, la data debe ser utilizada como un soporte de pequeñas mejoras sostenidas en el tiempo.En general se trata de un libro entretenido e informativo, producto de un erudito del deporte. Incluye muchas referencias a jugadores históricos y equipos de diversas ligas que los aficionados, estoy seguro, reconoceran inmeditamente. Por mi parte, lo encontré a veces un poco excesivo en su recurso a la anécdota. Podría haber sido editado un poco más, ya que algunos capítulos son excesivamente largos y contienen muchas digresiones que distraen del tema central.", 3 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45029227/reviews
464,"This fell somewhere between Soccernomics and one of Michael Calvin's books, as Biermann explored the metrics that are now being used to analyse football, but also gained access to people at the vanguard of using them.Soccernomics was the first mainstream book that looked at data to explain football, and given the frenzy to emulate the Oakland A's it is perhaps surprising that it's still seen as a bit nerdy 10 years on. As Biermann interviews many men (as he says, it's always men) involved in analytics, the reader is given the impression that clubs employ the analysts, but only a proportion actually use them. Biermann starts off the book by noting that a lot of football results can be attributed to luck, but Chris Anderson doesn't help the geeks' cause. After writing The Numbers Game he is interviewed in the book, and appears surprised that running a football club in the third tier actually involved practical aspects of the job, rather than playing Football Manager in real life. Less flippantly, the best analysis in the world still requires a coach willing to implement the ideas.A lot of the focus was understandably on the author's homeland of Germany, but he also got access to Midtjylland as well as discussing Liverpool, and it was written well enough that it didn't matter. The section on Lucien Favre I found really interesting, and gave me the sense that analysis is partly finding patterns in data, and partly improving the metrics you generate. Packing was quite interesting, but it was also quite difficult to work out whether making it a target would improve a team's performance, or whether it was merely a reflection of performance. When fewer stats were available, possession was deemed a great KPI, before it was found that merely increasing the stat didn't improve performance in itself.The author recommends three books as further reading, but having read all of them I think this was the best. It didn't try to draw snappy conclusions like The Numbers Game but still felt closer to the actual world of football than Soccernomics or Soccermatics. Partly this was the access, but as he related it to individual matches at times this covered the big picture and the details, and though it didn't have any explosive revelations, it did give a fascinating insight into one part of the sport.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45029227/reviews
465,"[4/5] This is one of those books I expected to love. I love football and data, after all. I really liked it in the end, but it didn’t start great.The author spends a lot of time in the beginning on xG and people who created mathematical models that could not be properly presented or explained. Then gets to the norm-breakers and talks about Tuchel and Guardiola, but towards the end of that section (with the importance of set pieces) it starts getting more interesting.The part after that is far more interesting as he dives into more advanced xG concepts, PPDA, various packing metrics, dangerosity, then the various scouting tools and finally how teams are using data and technology to improve the mental aspects of their players’ game.It is an interesting overview (and history) of looking at football through numbers and I thought the author did really well considering his lack of knowledge in the general data/tech area. To me as an analyst it also brought up many interesting questions that seem to pop up no matter which industry you’re in - is more complex always better and how can we still get value from all of these metrics and models? How do we get from descriptive to prescriptive? How do we get the stakeholders’ buy-in?A few years into the future, it’s interesting to see where some of the mentioned people ended up, most notably Brentford as a stable PL team, Ankersen is now at Southampton, statsbomb and Ted Knutson outgrew their then status of a blog to become a huge player in the industry and are competing with the likes of opta.It would be nice to read an updated version of this book at some point, to see how far it has all come since the original, but for now this one is more than enough to make any football and data fan happy.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45029227/reviews
466,"A status report from 2019 of how football analytics is used. Many examples from German football.A few of the things that stuck with me:In the context of expected goals (xG), the result that the difference between Christiano Ronaldo and an avergage player is only about 2 percentage points (13.3% of his shots resulting in goals vs the league average of 11.1%, page 34). The reason he scores so many goals is that he shoots more, and from better positions, than the average player.I also liked the graphs of how the xG changed over complete games from the 2018 World Cup. Quite illuminating, along with the figures for the match odds based on simulations of the shots (page 37 and onwards).Also quite interesting was how Dortmund was 17:th in the table, but had had a lot of bad luck compared to all the chances they created.There is also a lot of information on the clubs Midtjylland (Denmark) and Brentford (England) on how they are adopting ""moneyball"" for football. Also good was the discussion of ""packing"" - the number of players that are taken out by a pass or dribble, as well as the concept of ""dangerosity"".Overall, a good book if you are interested in football analytics. The book meanders a bit through different subjects though, and it also feels like a snapshoot of the development at that point in time, more than a complete primer on football analytics. But that is mostly because there is a lot of development in this space.If you are interested in football analytics, there is a course given by David Sumpter of Uppsala University that I really enjoyed.

467,"Football Hackers: The Science and Art of a Data Revolution (2019) by Christoph Bierman is an excellent read about the modern application of statistics to soccer. Soccer, or football as it will be referred to from here on, is very difficult to apply statistics to. Possession, shots taken and passed made can all be deceptive. Prior to the modern era of ubiquitous digital footage of thousands of games and the availability of cheap computing power coming up with better football statistics has not been possible. Charles Reep's simplistic counting of passes being the best known failed example.  But today with annotations available for thousands of games a year being done more sophisticated analysis has become possible. In the book Bierman talks to a number of modern football statistics innovators and  describes their influence on the modern game. To anyone who is familiar with these ideas the first new metric Xg or expected goals should be familiar. But other concepts such as 'packing', PPDA, dangerousity and others are likely to be new. The book has lots of examples from Bierman's home country of Germany and quite a few from other places. Football Hackers is well worth reading for anyone interested in how to apply statistics to a complex, flowing game. For anyone interested in getting a feel for what's coming in modern football it's highly recommended. It's also well written and flows well from concept to concept and person to person. ", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45029227/reviews

The author also brings up a host of innovative coaches who revolutionized the game with different outlooks on how the game should be played as well as scouting techniques used to find players to work within those systems. In addition, there is also some good reading material referenced as well.Overall, this is a five plus star read.

It turned out to be rather interesting, with a very long chapter dedicated to a number of metrics we have tried, with various degree of success, to deconstruct the sport, chasing a dream of finding a surefire way to build a data-drive, Moneyball like success story..One thing I do appreciate is the book's recognition for the capriciousness of the game and a complex system surrounding the pitch. The data will tell a story of the game - not the story, and most people inside and outside of the sports are still trying to understand what all these numbers are useful for. As the book suggests, the hardest part is not to come up with new concepts like  Expected Goals, Packing, Dangerousity, but to be able to apply these mathematically-inspired insights in a system prone to irrationality and knee-jerk decisions.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45029227/reviews

I wholeheartedly agree with Biermann. Data tells a story. But it is not THE story. It's another tool in the belt. Though quantitative analysis in football is in its infancy relative to American sports, its development will help inform judgements about the world's most popular sport. Football is predisposed to random events. And unlike basket or rugby, performance is weakly correlated with results.

It seems this would be extremely important to cover in great detail in a book specifically on fraud detection. Perhaps they wanted to keep the book more accessible, but this makes me wonder what we're supposed to get from this book that isn't covered more extensively in the dozens, if not hundreds, of other introductory 'data science' books (again considering that there's not much more domain knowledge in the book than you could quickly get from a Google search). Gold standard is the 'Elements of Statistical Learning' books, which come in varying levels of difficulty. I would recommend reading those and looking for more detailed texts on any of the subjects they don't cover (e.g. statistical network analysis).", 2 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26151889/reviews

488,"This is absolutely an excellent textbook to introduce students into, and master the basics of, the field of high-dimensional probability. Chapters 1-7 are most well-written and nicely structured. The later chapters, such as Chapter 9 and 11, are a bit short and less elaborated, giving an unfinished feeling. This is a bit disappointing, because the author is a geometric functional analyst and I was expecting more geometric functional analysis could be discussed in those later chapters. The overall writing of the book is concise, without a lot of details. Thus, beginners are strongly encouraged to do all the exercises (especially the one-star and two-star ones) in order to have a better understanding of the content and the details. Three-star exercises may involve useful tricks and can generally be solved in a reasonable amount of time (with a certain degree of math maturity).

504,"For some reason even the phrase “big data” seems to put fear in the minds of many who come across the term, yet in many ways it is just like fixing the chimney pot on your house – it won’t be for everybody but with the right training and tools it need not be impossible, as long as you have the right mindset.This book manages to take the reader gently by the hand and give them an informed introduction to the world of big data, showing them how it can be utilised in business through a marketing-led perspective. Of course, not every company will generate or have a need for big data, yet for those who do it can be a goldmine of opportunities and potential. The amount of data being generated can be astounding - especially if a company utilises externally produced data sources – and it can feel as one is drowning in a sea of bits and bytes. The author helps identify possible situations where big data sources can be exploited for marketing and customer relationship management purposes, although the harder task of implementation is left to the reader.Naturally important issues concerning privacy, data protection and industry best practice are also considered so you hopefully won’t shoot yourself in the foot with your first foray into big data exploitation. In some ways big data might even be a bit of a leveller for companies, allowing the smaller and more agile player to gain market share through their use of big data and intelligent analysis. You just have to be innovative in thought, approach and your use of data-led activities.Big data does not just refer to the physical amount of data being gathered; it also can relate to the speed it is generated, the range of data being collected and its scope. A lot of the benefits can be realised by sifting through an often fine-grained, relational and flexible series of data for the special nuggets of information that possibly nobody else has yet found to tailor-make your marketing and sales propositions. It might not be a licence to print money, yet it can provide an intelligent, data-led approach to servicing existing customer relationships and attracting new customers without recourse to the old-fashioned shotgun-style approach.Yet there is resistance, as the author notes: “There is a huge opportunity for brands to make use of big data but it requires a change of mindset. There are many vested interests that have talked about the potential of big data but in a way that maintains a simplistic approach to consumer understanding: allowing the data to ‘speak for itself' rather than thinking about what it means; accepting reductionist views of human behaviour rather than recognizing that a higher-level order of explanation is often needed; using a range of data-derived metrics simply because you can, not because they mean anything; implementing customer management programmes that are efficient because they are data-mediated but not considering the impact on the brand.”This is a very open, clear book that gives you a lot to think about, even if you have no specific plans or needs to exploit big data. After reading it, you probably will be thinking differently if you had not already been sold on the idea! Looking at the methodologies and structures behind big data usage can still yield benefits in “little data” or “no data” environments. Like panning for gold, you still need to shake the tray and put some effort in…One good example of the disadvantages of data mining given is relevant in every business situation. Just because the information given says X, it doesn’t mean you have to act on it. The author recounts a business class flight between two European capitals where insufficient catering was loaded so someone had to go hungry. The staff blindly took the data-led approach and decided that the traveller with the lesser status (frequent flyer miles) should receive a downgraded service: a pregnant lady who was gallantly offered the meal of a fellow traveller (with much higher status) when he discovered this brilliant example of customer service, all based on data!“It is clear that one of the key challenges is for brands to take an intelligent approach to the way in which they critically examine their data assets. I don't think that many organizations have yet properly adjusted their processes for big data sets – a more coherent approach is often required. Once a brand has processes in place that undertake the ‘due diligence' on the way in which data assets are being handled, we can focus on the actions required to drive insight from the data,” notes the author. Despite this being a very complex, inter-connected subject, this is a fairly light, open and jargon-free read. A pleasurable, thought-provoking book that might be a little shocking for those companies that need a bash around the corporate head with a “clue stick.”Humanizing Big Data, written by Colin Strong and published by Kogan Page.

505,"In our vastly expansive information age we have never been in more need of true insight. This book is a positive critique of the current tools and frameworks at the disposal of academics, marketers, researchers and business leaders to make sense of data. The most refreshing theme is the author's humanist approach to understanding - consumers, customers, citizens, users - as real people. In a business world overloaded with data, the tendency for businesses is to take a very atomistic approach to the use of data. This book illustrates the need to recognise the more nuanced influences on human behaviour such as context, network effects and our innate irrationalities.The key messages I took away from this book were:Misinformation is worse than being under informed. This is an important reminder of how to use data to create competitive advantage and not set off on the wrong path. With a background in market research it's good to see the author apply the same level of critique to existing market research practices as he does to data analytics. This leads him to advocate a middle ground that fuses of both worlds in an attempt to minimise the risk of misinformation.We are not 1s and 0s, we are human. We must not forget that we, as individuals, are influenced by wider social groups. Our networks and environment influence how we behave and think. There are lots of practical examples of how to apply the social science's rich understanding of human behaviour to how we approach data in the business world.Strong customer relationships cannot rely on personalisation. Some of the most compelling sections of this book is when the author introduces his own research. The most interesting is the discovery of the uncanny valley effect on brand attachment as a consequence of personalised marketing. Whilst there are increasing returns for brands personalising their marketing, it will ultimately reach a point where it gets too creepy and consumers react adversely towards the brand. This raises lots of questions and debate about how to build relationships with customers in a digital world. As potential solutions, the author discusses data privacy and the use/control of personal data to develop more meaningful value exchanges.Overall, this is a thoughtful and constructive book that takes a strong viewpoint on how brands can capitalise on the opportunities presented by the data economy.

506,"The ultimate in human intelligence (humint) This book is mostly about the utilization of the big data generated by humans in their online social interactions. It is a massive and dynamic dataset with valuable links deeply embedded and hidden within it. There are the companion problems of privacy and ownership issues as well. Hardly a day goes by without mention of a major breach of a dataset that exposed personal information to people that could use it for nefarious purposes.  There are some very big plums that can be picked from this dataset, yet there are significant hurdles that must be overcome. Strong does a good job in setting up these scenarios of the value to be acquired as well as some of the major hurdles.  My favorite section of the book by far was the discussion of what is called the “uncanny valley.” This is where pushing a brand or idea forward has a positive response until a critical point is reached where the response reaches a peak and then dramatically declines in a linear manner. The effect was first proposed to explain the phenomenon where robots are met with approval until they start exhibiting too many human traits. Another example cited is where animation was used to create human-like characters for major motion pictures. This is an interesting idea and while not proven, it would explain a great deal about some major marketing failures. It can also explain people reaching a point where marketing hints begins to “creep them out” when they start being too accurate and predictive.  This is a book that does not use technical jargon or expressions to make the points, so the general person working in marketing can understand it. Reading it will at minimum give them some valuable ideas regarding how to execute their next major marketing move. As the political ads for the presidential election are now appearing, it is clear to me that the people running those marketing programs REALLY need to read this book.This book was made available for free for review purposes and this review also appears on Amazon", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18467587/reviews
507,"This title provides a detailed understanding of the way to approach and think about the challenges and opportunities of big data, enabling any brand to realize the value of their current and future data assets. First it explores the 'nuts and bolts' of data analytics and the way in which the current big data agenda is in danger of losing credibility by paying insufficient attention to what are often fundamental tenets in any form of analysis. Next it sets out a manifesto for a smart data approach, drawing on an intelligent and big picture view of data analytics that addresses the strategic business challenges that businesses face. Finally it explores the way in which datafication is changing the nature of the relationship between brands and consumers and why this calls for new forms of analytics to support rapidly emerging new business models.

521,"INTRODUCING DATA SCIENCE is a broad introduction to the field. Each chapter includes the theory, as well as practical examples. This is a big, complex field, and this book will take some time to absorb. For example, the authors illustrate in Chapter 6 the large number of database products that are used in this field. These include both ""NoSQL,"" as well as ""New SQL"" designs. There isn't just one ""right"" method. To be honest, I didn't know there was any such thing as ""graphical"" databases.I recommend trying some of the detailed examples to get a feel for the subject matter. For example, the authors show, in detail, how to use Wikipedia with a custom Python program to try some data mining. The example pretends that you are trying to research diseases, using information in Wikipedia, and show you how to write your program.I thought the best chapter was Chapter 6, ""Join the NoSQL Movement."" Here, the authors explain the intrinsic limitations of the traditional RBBMS structure. A typical RDBMS table is stored with ALL the columns together. This often works well, but what if you only want certain columns? Well, that's too bad--you will end up ""touching"" all the other columns as well.Column databases don't have the above limitation. So, they are far faster are scanning through large amounts of information, when you just want certain columns. (As an Oracle DBA for several decades, I can confirm that the authors correctly state the limitation.)So all in all, I found INTRODUCING DATA SCIENCE to be a very good book--albeit a bit overwhelming. I found the examples especially helpful.

548,"Any effort to teach numerical and statistical literacy to a general audience is a good one. In chapters that present and analyze statistical argumentation, with an emphasis on the social sciences, Prof. Klass's treatment dissects the valid and invalid rhetoric that surrounds highly charged policy topics of today, from crime to healthcare reform to education to global warming, with a passing mention of ""Moneyball"" sabermetrics in baseball for a topical change of pace. Students assigned chapters from this book prior to classroom discussions will be immediately engaged, if perhaps triggered into preconceived notions and biases due to the politically contentious nature of the examples; Klass deserves kudos for confronting today's issues rather than retreating to safer territory. Most compelling and useful to all viewpoints is the section presenting statistical fallacies within the broader category of classical fallacies of logic. My only criticism: while students will know how to rip apart a faulty statistical presentation after absorbing the book's lessons, there is somewhat less emphasis on the original construction of proper statistical arguments.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14366375/reviews
549,"This book discusses how to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and logic to leadership. It serves as a reminder to readers that the divide between data science and business may be quite costly. AI and analytics (AIA) can be an effective approach as suggested by the authors to narrow the gap in business processes. The book is organized in such a way that each component adds to readers’ comprehension of AIA in the organizational context, assisting them in increasing their “data science intuition quotient” (DSIQ). The book discusses critical issues such as the distinction between data integrity and the concept of “truth in data”– the idea that in most business scenarios, there can be multiple, competing truths that can only be understood through multiple angles, parameters, and, most importantly, a manager who understands the inputs and outputs. The book might be useful for business managers and executives who are in charge of implementing AI in their organizations.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54083653/reviews

Elsewhere, I think it sacrifice clarify for brevity with some of the mathematics presentation; sometimes I feel like I'm trying to read the author's mind trying to figure out how he got from one line of the algebra to the next (although I suppose this is a common criticism I have for text books). I also feel like it needed a lot of practical examples for each of the models; I had folks asking me about ML stuff I've learned from the book, but I struggle to explain it beyond the way the book has.

573,"The proverb “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime,” is known by almost everyone. In Malware Data Science: Attack Detection and Attribution, authors Joshua Saxe and Hillary Sanders artfully show the reader how not only to avoid being a victim of malicious code, but how to actively defend against it, and even build your own systems to do that.Malware is such a huge issue, that many anti-virus vendors update their signatures hourly to deal with the never-ending set of threats. The authors work at Sophos (Chief Data Scientist and Infrastructure Data Science Team Lead, respectively) and have written a highly technical and effective guide that readers can use to implement their own defensive systems.At the start, the authors define data science as, “A growing set of algorithmic tools that allow users to understand and make predictions about data using statistics, mathematics, and artful statistical data visualizations.” The book focuses on data science as it applies to malware, which they define as, “executable programs written with malicious intent.”The book is meant as an introduction to the use of data science to malware analysis and detection. The authors take a broad approach to the topic and discuss static malware analysis, x86 disassembly, dynamic analysis and identifying attack campaigns using malware networks. Later chapters detail how the reader can build machine learning detectors, neural network malware detector, and more.The book is insightful for all information security professionals in general, but more specifically those who code and can read code, specifically in Python. The authors provide many code and data samples and have included all of them on the book’s web site. There the reader can also find instructions for downloading and running a VirtualBox Ubuntu virtual machine which contains the book's code, data, and all of the requisite dependencies.The book closes with a chapter on becoming a data scientist, where the authors discuss the paths to becoming a security data scientist and a day in the life of a security data scientist. More importantly, they detail the traits of an effective security data scientist. For those looking to become a security data scientist, or just want to get a comprehensive understanding of how to use data science to deal with malicious software, Malware Data Science: Attack Detection and Attribution is a superb reference to help you get there.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38213382/reviews
574,"Since this is a technical book, just some random thoughts while reading it:- Too shallow. It needlessly goes into unhelpful details, but then doesn't expend on the meaningful details that require more in-depth explanations. From the first few chapters I doubt even a novice would benefit anything, and the book could have began in chapter five with a much shorter preamble before that. There's one place that it gives an ""in a nutshell"" explanation followed by an ""in depth"" one, but the in depth practically just repeats what was said before and calls the rest ""out of scope of this book"".- Badly written. Especially uses a lot of phrasing which sound foreign and sort of makes me read it with an accent. Things like ""First I show you X. Second I show you Y. Then you learn to Z"" or ""In chapter X you learned to Y and Z, you are now learning to Q"".- It feels more like a first year of uni project that summarises another work, rather than a professional book written by experts in the field.- The only plus to this book is that towards the end in touches on some interesting topics, and after reading it, it gives you at least the proper terms to be able to talk about it. But then again so would a list of terms that link to wikipedia and other sources, which is mostly what I read while reading this book.- Took to reading it because it was on Tal's desk.

As part of my learning journey, I read this book in order to familiarize myself with the vocabulary and inner workings of data science. I'm glad Numsense exists because most of the books on the market are written for developers - in other words, they are too technical. This books fills an important gap: if we want our world to prosper and our businesses to thrive, we need to democratize DS so as many people as possible know what it is and how to use it. This book has three strengths:1. It's an easy and insightful read.A high school student probably can read it without much effort. However, that is not to say the book is simplistic. On the contrary, the authors did an excellent job of distilling DS concepts (e.g. k-Means, Principle Component Analysis etc) to their very essence - a genuine accomplishment!2. It has tons of visuals that aid comprehension.The authors included plenty of graphs, tables, and illustrations to explain DS concepts that are a feast for the eyes. Where words fail (and they rarely do), visuals come to the rescue.3. It consists of many helpful examples.DS (and AI, really) has no value if you don't put it into good use. The book is equally strong on theory AND practice. You'll get a good sense of how DS algorithms are actually applied in the real world.All in all, highly recommended for anyone (not just those working for a tech company, like I do) interested in the art and science of data science - and my sincere thanks for Annalyn and Kenneth who made DS so accessible to many of us laymen!", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34213247/reviews

The examples are not well picked and in the absence of detail, there aren't enough metaphors to explain how things work.Read it if you want to get a vague sense of what Machine Learning is about, but if you want to get into it, you would have to learn everything covered in this book properly, from a different source.", 2 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34213247/reviews

This isn't a book about R per se, but a book about how to choose and attack datascience projects (and maybe the title is misleading since most of us ""data science"" types actually do data analysis or data engineering). The chapter on classification and clustering algorithms is a perfect example. They use R to teach the algos, rather than using algo examples to walk you through coding in R.It's easy enough to just follow along with the code in the book, but you'll get the most out of it if you sit down with RStudio and work through it.Couldn't be happier having spent the money for a dead-tree copy of this one.

However, as the title implies, it is geared towards those looking for only a high-level, quick overview to Data Science practices as they apply in the business world as well as how to communicate results to non-practitioners and business partners. If this is what you are looking for then I recommend this book. If you are looking for a more in-depth introduction to the theory of data science and machine learning, I would look elsewhere, as the topics are covered in a very superficial manner. Had I done more research into this book before purchasing, I would not have bought it; instead opting for a more theoretical and statistics-heavy primer.

This book suffers this malaise, it struggles to explain the principles and sometimes is even wrong about basic concepts in stats (for example, the explanation of heteroscedasticity). Not everything was terrible, it introduces R, version control, databases, a bit of visualization and some techniques that everyone doing data science should have on their toolbox.

619,"(This is my January book for my ""read one work book per month"" New Year's resolution.)Good practical book on applying machine learning. Lots of examples, though I probably would have appreciated more effort to use a single domain or ""business"", rather than constantly leaping around, just because taking a number of approaches to a single problem area is a useful skill to develop. I'd also have liked to see more generic functions: most of their illustrations would need to adapted. For example, they used a ""..."" notation in their function for calculation of Euclidean distance to indicate that you do the calculation for each dimension, but it would have been trivial to write the function to take the number of dimensions from the input vectors. Final quibble is that their treatment of kernels and SVMs seemed far more theoretical than the other sections.So not, a definitive reference, but definitely a good book to have on your shelf when working an ML project in R.Also, I seem to recall that they had a n-part series on their blog recently on verification and validation of models...maybe for the second edition, they'll add a chapter specifically on this topic, in addition to the tips throughout on which summary stats are indicating model soundness.

625,"""Predictive Analytics"" is a summary of the state of the art in using computer models to predict individuals actions. I work in the industry and have developed predictive financial models. This book isn't aimed at people like me, at least not ones looking for a more technical, how-to explanation. Instead, this is more a survey of the field, including plentiful real-world examples and some high-level definitions. The definitions of lift, ensemble modeling, and uplift modeling I found new and interesting, although the explanation of uplift modeling is a bit of a miss. I think the value in the book is in the examples. There are many examples of PA in action, some short descriptions and some, like IBM's Watson, taking a full chapter. If you think better with examples, this is a good book but with a caveat. The examples are very high level and don't contain much if any technical detail. This is best for examples of what can be done, not how to do it. I also found it strange that I got the feeling that the author presents PA as something new, when based on his definitions and examples, some of these concepts and methods and projects are decades old. You get the impression that you are being sold something as NEW, when in fact it is just WHERE WE ARE NOW in the technology. This absolutely meets my criteria as a good business book -- it gives you the concepts to think in new ways about problems, and it provides examples that can be generalized into a number of different applications throughout a company.

627,"Not thoughtfully written and shallowly propagandistic. It joins so much hype and adds little to the brimming pot. The last couple of chapters are more digestible, but still doesn't do much beyond illuminating the very basics of PA. Here's a bit of my review for book club: I’ll start with positives: Love the suggestion that marketing departments that manufacture quasi-medical data should have to deal with it in a substantive way. That is a solution I haven’t heard proposed yet, but what if HIPAA, FERPA, etc. and all those “cumbersome bureaucratic” measures could weigh down every advertising outfit and data brokerage firm and social media giant that is able to manufacture sensitive data about people outside their domain? “You made it, you manage it.” (Author’s italics.) (Chapter 2, Good Prediction, Bad Prediction) Another important caveat he does actually cover is the following: there can be heightened human trust in technical systems (as with judges and parole boards in Chapter 2, Machine Risk Without Measure). “What may render judges better informed could also sway them toward less active observation and thought, tempting them to defer to the technology...and grant it undue credence."" So we can say that automated decision support systems can actually undermine the likelihood for the humans you’re organizing to interact in the way that you are trying to prompt them to. So my substantive suggestion is more about how we want to treat “data science”. Based on what I’m gathering from this book, I suggest that people who practice predictive analytics should be called “mathematicians”, “statisticians”, or “predictive analysts”. As Siegel himself says, “PA’s mission is to engineer solutions,” and “Whatever works.” It seems to be about finding correlative relationships that help figure out how to get the right people to see the right ads. (But let’s be real — that’s largely what data scientists are spending their talent on.) It doesn’t sound like they’re doing science. It’s just a method that may be used in science, but is largely used elsewhere as well. Siegel provides a helpful foil for me to make this argument. Because it was part of the established practice of science, the scientific study done by Gilbert and Karahalios of stock market and blog post anxiety measures received criticism until it found a way to establish causation, or predictive direction. The work that statisticians/predictive analysts are doing doesn’t come under this scrutiny if they are in business. The assertion that we don’t care what’s under the hood because the “black box” just gives us the predictions is anti-scientific. Predictive analysts don’t have to start with a theory, or even come to a theory when they find relationships in the data. Sure, this method can be part of actual science, but it clouds up the meaning to call them scientists because they’re just doing math in law enforcement, healthcare, insurance, and human resources, and so forth. But calling it science artificially colors what is being done in these different domains — it’s possible that none of it is part of the scientific process because it may not ever be based on a theory, it may not be done in public or with the benefit of the scientific community’s oversight. It’s not necessarily building upon itself toward more insights. Predictive analysts work towards enough prediction to make companies more money, predict more accidents, etc. But it doesn’t seem to ask why. It's not done as a search for how the world really works. PA is used to drive decisions, says Siegel. It’s a method that is about decision-making without wisdom or understanding. Siegel’s own repetition about the primacy of advertising assures me that as a method, it’s bound up with making profit in a way that even could undermine its ability to be used for science. “Benjamin Franklin forgot to include [advertising] when he proclaimed ’Nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” (Chapter 1)But it unfairly receives the automatic clout assigned to anything with the word “science” in it.", 1 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16649210/reviews
628,"This book is extremely introductory, which accounts for Siegel's 50,000-foot view of the topic. Yet, I came away feeling there could have been more details on the ""how"" of predictive analytics without destroying the book's aim of being an overview. Rather than droning on about IBM's Watson, I thought Siegel could have spent a little more time explaining the logic behind building decision trees and preparing the training data. Instead, we get about 100 pages of fluff out of a 217-page text. A typical chapter starts with an interesting tease story and quickly veers off into a ""let me tell you about my grandchildren"" tangent before the reader gets to the real meat, what little there is, the book has to offer. If you already know that PA involves probability, massive data sets, and decision trees, you already know 99% of what Siegel says in this book. As a matter of fact, Siegel sums up the whole book in a one page appendix of five principles.

Siegel does a good job explaining how valuable data is and convinces us that with smart, predictive modeling, data can change how we market to customers and increase our efficacy on the business front. I appreciated him tackling the different types of predictive models from a high-level and laying it out in a way that is entirely digestible to someone at arm's length. A few drawbacks of the book are its limited case studies or not investing enough into the ones he does present.

664,"Making sense out of massive data for product refinement with simple tools. This is what Joanne Rodrigues' goal is for her book Product Analytics: Applied Data Science Techniques for Actionable Consumer Insights. It does the job well. The subject matter was written for applied practice by non academics. In addition the book is structured for quick referencing. Definition, real world examples and applications are included. This book is worthy to be part of your reference collection.As you begin your read, note that the writing strives to be concise and understandable. This is one of important aspects of this book. It was written as a reference for techniques and the tools needed for successful product analytics and data analysis. The book even includes an introduction to R and a guided setup.Another helpful aspect of Rodrigues' book is that sections are structured to cover each topic in depth. If you understand and have a good grasp of A/B testing, skip Chapter 6 and move to Chapter 7 which covers k-Means and PCA.Last, real world examples emphasizing the techniques and tools are included in this book. Rodriques takes her time to provide explanations and techniques for product analytics. You'll find NBA players' heights used to explain mean, median, and mode. She even shares a behavioral change worksheet for A/B testing.Succint and easily understandable, this book is an exciting intro for new folks in product analytics and an everlasting reference for long term practitioners.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55127544/reviews

667,"This book is not terrible but it could have been a lot better. The English is poor (the author is Italian, I think - certainly not a native English speaker, anyway) which makes it harder to follow what's going on - though not impossible. But here's the real problem; I am still spending more time looking things up online than in either of the two books on Python I have. This, to me, means they can't be good. By contrast, Mastering MATLAB 7, is excellent and my copy is showing signs of imminent collapse through heavy use.What's the difference? Total information content and it's presentation. The Matlab book contains vastly more info and much of it is concentrated in tables. My copy has a profusion of little post-it notes marking pages with reference tables that I use frequently. These are conspicuous by their absence in Python Data Analytics, except in the case of a comprehensive appendix on Latex codes for use in plot annotation.My search for a decent Python/SciKit reference goes on.", 2 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33125361/reviews
668,"It's hard to explain this book, mostly because it's hard to get to whom it is targeted.Is it targeted to people that already know Machine Learning and want to learn Python? No, the book goes into lengths into some algorithms and has ""easy to write, but not quite right"" code to do so.Is it targeted to people that know Python but want to learn Machine Learning? No; even if some algorithms are explained in length, some aren't and there is very little ""you use this when you have data like that"" explanations. Actually, there is very little explanation on where an algorithm should be used.Is it targeted to people that don't know Python and don't know Machine Learning and want to learn but? This is the gray area of the book: Again, the code is pretty simple and does not follow Python coding standards and the ML part is really shallow on the ""when"" and ""why"" sections.In the end, the book is simply an extended version of Scikit-Learn manual -- and I even have doubts if the manual isn't better because it explains when an algorithm should be used.", 2 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25527772/reviews
669,"If someone contextualizes their practical challenges as guidelines, it is a great upper hand for the learners. Alberto Boschetti and Luca Massaron give advice with clearly set out boundaries to contextualisation to ensure readers can readily determine what is acceptable to the industry. This advice develops around scenarios, examples and codes of data science projects.The authors are data scientists with expertise in statistics, linking with other sophisticated technical subject fields. This book has simplified the complexities that are relevant to beginners and intermediate data scientists with their understanding may have faced in using Python. In this book, users are recommended Python 3.4 or above for all its examples to practice.The book engages and absorbs the reader into the subject matter involving almost all the human senses. The beauty of the book is that it has six chapters linked with resources (data and source codes). These resources are of immense value and will surely intrigue both beginners, and intermediate users. At the beginning of each chapter readers are able to clearly visualise what will be learnt during the chapter. The book gives more extensive knowledge about practical data mining principals through scientific methodology and effectively tests the performance of the user's machine learning hypothesis.If the reader studies the book and completes the lab practice, it is a great chance to enhance user data manipulation and machine learning skills.In this second edition, it is evident the authors have invested both time and effort, and have listened to user feedback to improve this particular edition. This edition displays more maturity and delivers more focus on updated and expanded content. Chapter four on Machine Learning in this second edition is an excellent move I think, as it’s one of the most widely used data science techniques with python.Visualize the machine learning and optimisation processes the authors discuss in chapter 3, ‘The Data Pipeline’, and chapter 4, ‘Machine Learning’. If readers choose to get colour images of this book, there is the facility, and I am sure it is a bonus for the readers.I recommend this book to all data science labs if they are dedicated to investing real industry experiences to successfully obtain their future research project deliverables.This 354 page book is an excellent guide on learning data science through python for those aspiring to become experienced in it. It is also one of the few books that one will find truly practical and engaging.Review by Prof. Kalum Priyanath UdagepolaOriginally posted: http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/...", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25527772/reviews

677,"""Data Science mit Python für Dummies"" wirbt auf dem Cover mit dem Text „Einführung in Python und die Programmumgebung Anaconda“, „solider Überblick über die Python-Bibliotheken für Data Science“, „Daten vorbereiten, verarbeiten, visualisieren“. Vor dem Hintergrund dieses Werbetextes und des Reihentitels ""... für Dummies"" habe ich eine (wenn auch nur kurze) Einführung in Python und die Datenanalyse erwartet, also ein Buch für Anfänger. Dieser Band baut jedoch auf Python programmieren lernen fr Dummies auf, das reine Einsteiger vorher lesen sollten.Auf den ersten 55 Seiten werden zunächst die Vorzüge von Python blumig beschrieben. Inhaltlich ist praktisch nichts geboten. Anschließend wird die Installation der Programmierumgebung Anaconda erläutert, leider jedoch nicht, was Anaconda eigentlich ist. An dieser Stelle fehlt, welche Programme und zugehörigen Bibliotheken dieses Buch nutzt. Noch wichtiger: dass Anakonda neben der reinen Programmierumgebung auch alle diese Bibliotheken mitbringt. Stattdessen wird man in dem Buch plötzlich mit einem System namens Python Notebook konfrontiert und hat keine Vorstellung, warum und wofür (das muss man einfach wissen). Auch sollen bereits Beispiele in Python Notebook eingegeben werden, noch bevor die Installation beschrieben wurde. So zieht sich das Buch weitere ca. 50 Seiten hin. Erst wenn es um den Einsatz der einzelnen Bibliotheken geht, wird das Buch etwas systematischer und geht auf die einzelnen Data Science Bbibliotheken ein. Dabei fehlen …- eine Einführung in Python, die man aufgrund des Titelblatts erwarten könnte- eine systematische Einführung in Data Science- ein umfangreiches, durchgehendes Beispiel, um die Datenanalyse, Komprimierung, Aufbereitung und Darstellung in einem größeren Zusammenhang von Anfang bis Ende zu zeigen.Stilistisch wirkt das Buch durchgehend verschwurbelt, in Bandwurm-Satzungetümen umständlich und dadurch teils unpräzise. Satzkonstruktionen aus bis zu 6 Teilsätzen müssen auch in Fachtexten nicht sein. Die Marotte, das Verb häufig ans Ende dieser langen Sätze zu stellen, anstatt möglichst weit vorn, macht die Misere nicht besser. Ich hatte ständig den Eindruck, dass ich mit dem englischen Original besser klarkommen würde, weil ich dann wenigstens nicht darüber nachdenken müsste, ob die Übersetzung den Text verschlimmert hat.Das Layout der Printausgabe ist von mäßiger Qualität. Die notwendigen unterschiedlichen Schrifttypen könnten deutlicher voneinander zu unterscheiden sein. Die ebook-Ausgabe für Tablet und Smartphone zeigt immerhin noch eine zweite Schriftfarbe für die Überschriften und farbige Icons, die auf dem ebook-Reader leider nicht nutzbar ist.--> Nutzen Sie bitte vor dem Kauf den Blick ins Buch und laden evtl. eine ebook-Leseprobe der Originalausgabe.Fazit:Um Data Science mit Python sinnvoll zu nutzen, sollte Python bereits bekannt sein, sowie die Vorgehensweisen und Systematiken des Data Science. Ein Anfänger, der die Hürde mit der Programmumgebung und Python nimmt, kennt anschließend immerhin viele Werkzeuge in Python und wie man sie nutzen kann. Deshalb 3 Sterne für den sachlichen Inhalt, für die Systematik und Didaktik des Buches allerdings nur einen.", 2 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25804287/reviews
678,"This book is a good introduction to Python and data science that covers a broad range of topics. I give it four stars for content.In terms of writing, formatting, and overall quality, I would give it two stars at most. The book seems to be published in a hurry without any editing.1) There are at least a dozen errors in the book. For example, at one place it says that values above upper quartile and below lower quartile are outliers. This is totally wrong since each accounts for 25% of the data! Later chapters do provide the correct information. Several similar incidents give the distinct impression that the book is written by two authors. 2) Many terms are used inconsistently or even incorrectly throughout the book, including samples, examples, variables, predictors, classes, models, algorithms, etc. Again, it is likely due to the different authorship and lack of editing.3) Introduction of datasets and concepts is out of order. For example, a dataset is used in a task, then a few chapters later, the same dataset appears again with a lengthy explanation of its background and details. Same with concepts - direct use first, definition later.4) Sloppy writing. Lots of sentences are simply awkward. For example, ""Each tree tries to build a model that successfully predicts what trees that were built before it weren't able to forecast"". Repetitive words and phrases abound - A paragraph with five lines might include the word 'example' four times; ""In fact"" appears at least 100 times in the book.I won't list all the formatting problems in case people think I am OCD. To summarize, this book gives a good overview of Python and Data Science to get people started in the field. A thorough careful editing would make it more valuable and less annoying.", 3 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25804287/reviews

681,"re you a Beginner who would like to learn python, in context with a specific area, and tired of using syntax focused books sans practical examples? ORAre you exploring data science landscape and want to see practical examples of how to actually use machine learning algorithms in data science context?If you answer in the affirmative to either of the questions above, ""Python for data science for dummies"" is the perfect book for you. Luca Massaron is a practicing data scientist, and a prolific author of several books including Regression Analysis with Python , Machine Learning For Dummies, Python Data Science Essentials, Regression Analysis with Python, and Large Scale Machine Learning with Python. He is also a leading Kaggle enthusiast, and you can see his 'practitioner fingerprints' all over this book; especially in later chapters about data processing, ETL, cleanup, data sources, and challenges.This book starts with the fundamentals of Python data analysis programming, and explains the setup of Python development environment using anaconda with IPython (Jupyter notebooks). Authors start by considering the emergence of data science, outline the core competencies of a data scientist, and describe the Data Science Pipeline before taking a plunge into explaining Python’s Role in Data Science and introducing Python’s Capabilities and Wonders.Once you get your bearings about the IDE setup, chapter 4 focuses on Basic Python before you get your Hands Dirty with Data. What I like about this manuscript is that the writing keeps it real. Instead of giving made up examples, authors talk about items like knowing when to use NumPy or pandas and real world scenarios like removing duplicates, creating a data map and data plan, dealing with Dates in Your Data, Dealing with Missing data, parsing etc; problems which practicing data scientists encounter on a daily basis.Contemporary topics like Text mining are also addressed in the book with enough details of topics such as working with Raw Text, Stemming and removing stop words, Bag of Words Model and Beyond, Working with n‐grams, Implementing TF‐IDF transformations, and adjacency matrix handling. This is also where you start getting a basic understanding of how machine learning algorithms work in practice.Practical aspects of evaluating a data science problem are addressed later, with techniques defined for researching solutions, formulating a hypothesis, data preperation, feature creation, binning and discretization, leading up to vectors and matrix manipulation, and visualization with MatPlotLib. Even though the book does not discuss theano, DL4J, Torch, Caffe or TensorFlow, it still provides an introduction to key python ML library Scikit‐learn. This 400 page book also covers key topics like SVD, PCA, NMF, Recommendation systems, Clustering, Detecting Outliers, logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Fitting a Model, bias and variance, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest classifiers to name a few. The resources provided in the end are definitely worth subscribing to for every self-respecting data science enthusiast.I highly recommend this book for those beginners interested in data science and also want to learn and leverage Python skills for this rapidly emerging field.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25804287/reviews

Doing that reminded me how much I love pipes, and I learned how amazingly easy it is to perform graph faceting is with ggplot.If you're just starting out with R, start here. It's going to give you the tools you need to do the work you want, and it'll train your brain to think in a way that aligns your data with your goals. If you've been using R at an intermediate-to-advanced level already, I'm not as convinced. You have a way that works for you, and you're getting what you need. Ultimately, R is just a tool to get what you need, and whether you build that with pipes, or a function, or a whole bunch of nested for-loops, you understand your code and that's just fine.Probably the biggest indicator that I'm going to be a grudging convert? The work I'm doing right now feels constrained by the fact that I'm annotating with long comments instead of committing to Rmarkdown.

I especially recommend it as the 1st book for software engineers who want to move into data science.Because the ""tidyverse"" libraries are very ""magical"", making extensive use of nonstandard syntactical features like unquoted column names, this book does not teach good general programming practices. Therefore I do not recommend it if you are unfamiliar with programming and want to learn.I recommend skipping Part IV entirely, as I feel the attempt at introducing regression in a non-mathematical way is largely a failure.

702,"It's unreal to me how helpful this book has already been for my coding - it made me want to be in the data analysis/graph creation part of my Master's program.I had no idea the Tidyverse could do most of the things described in this book! Additionally, the writing was straightforward, clear, and even funny at times. However, I would have been a bit lost if I wasn't a regular R user already (I'd not call this an intro book); many of the R basics are covered out of order - which is intuitive and great since I've used the software lots, but may have had me foundering if that wasn't the case.

703,"Excellent comprehensive reference to the tidyverse set of R packages. A couple of mistakes are present in the print version, but have been corrected in the publicly accessible online version.

704,"This is my new go-to book when someone asks me for an introduction to R.It teaches 'modern' R in form of the tidyverse (sometimes Hadleyverse), the set of packages the author has written that essentially replace most of the basic functionality of R. The tidyverse is logically coherent, someone actually sat down and thought things through - basic R grew over decades and it shows, many hands don't make a coherent structure.The book follows a logical 'story', starting with 1) data exploration, importing, and visualization to find patterns in data, followed by 2) data wrangling, i.e., subsetting and munging and tidying, followed by 3) actual programming - pipes, functions, iterating, then comes 4) modeling, how to build models and a few common models used in R, and it ends with 5), communicating, which is about various ways of writing reproducible reports and how to get publication-ready plots.Maybe you can get an idea of the contents by the books Wickham recommends:- The Truthful Art: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication- Presentation Patterns: Techniques for Crafting Better Presentations- The Non-Designer's Design Book- Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace- The Sense of Structure: Writing from the Reader's Perspective- Statistical Modeling: A Fresh ApproachI have a few minor nitpicks:- some sections use the cars and diamonds datasets, I can't stand those datasets anymore. Then again iris never shows up....- sometimes the author goes a bit overboard and the examples get too complex, I wouldn't be able to make these plots if you'd told me that I just read how to make them.Anyway, these are minor, to me this book is the best way if you want to see what modern R has to offer.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175687164/reviews
705,"Whatever R-related product, whether that is a package or a book / tutorial, that comes from Hadley Wickham is gold. After reading his ggplot2 book (and being amazed by the clarity and teaching prowess of the author) I dover into this one... Read the whole book in two weeks. In many ways it is similar to the ggplot2 book. It's an introductory version but at the same time one that covers a wide range of topics and does go somewhat deep. More importantly, it's a book that (like the ggplot2 book) will serve as a guideline for the future. It's almost impossible to learn everything in this book in one go - you'll most likely need years to do so.. and that's ok. The book is organized so well that you can easily reference back whenever you need some concept. That's how I intended on using it. I went through it without doing the exercises, making notes throughout the book so that I get a sense of what's there and where to find things I might need when coding. I strongly believe it will be counterproductive trying to learn everything before you start coding. The topics covered range from importing data, to data wrangling, graphing, modeling, and R markdown. Pretty much all you need to get started as a data scientist. Excellent. Could not recommend enough!", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175687164/reviews
706,"Finally, a good book on R that doesn't presume you are a stats buff. This book actually doesn't presume anything about you, and is written very clearly and with the right amount of to-the-point examples to get you going. I don't know how much my previous familiarity with R based on various other books and resources helped me get into the groove with this one, but R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund definitely taught me something I didn't know before in the least amount of time since I started reading it. The problem I now have is that Tidyverse introduces a different (and better) way of working with core R constructs, which also happens to be somewhat incompatible (or at least poorly fitting) with a number of decades of existing online R lore. Still, I'm happy I now have a clear guide to a better way of doing things in one book. I would recommend this as the first book on R for anyone who wants to get on board.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175687164/reviews
707,A splendid book on the language! The exercises are fun and engaging and the coding wisdom from the author is ever so helpful to navigate and troubleshoot. I think this is the one place to start learning R to be frank that covers all that it can do. Naturally other books elaborate on this further but there is no doubt how well Hadley and all the contributors to the book have worked to produce a streamlined and comprehensive book 📕. Well doneThere are some difficult sections on listing models and nesting and in nesting them but the author forewarned that this may need to be returned to at a later date. So certainly this book will not be a one time read. It is truly a book demonstrating well the power of good pedagogy on a technical matter. Seriously good stuff.Solutions are also available free online if you search for them. , 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175687164/reviews
708,"I think Hadley's contributions to `R` have been amazing, even staggering. It's good to see that he's taken all of the ideas of the `tidyverse` world and put them into a written format. If you've used `R` in the past but mainly use base functions then this will be a great refresher for you. If you're new to the world of `R` then this book will give you a solid foundation of how to get started.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175687164/reviews

710,"""R für Data Science"" von Hadley Wickham ist zweifellos ein geeignetes Buch für jeden, der sich mit Datenwissenschaft und Datenanalyse beschäftigt. In diesem umfassenden Werk gelingt es dem Autor, komplexe Konzepte und Methoden der Datenanalyse in R auf eine klare und praxisorientierte Weise zu vermitteln. Das Buch eignet sich besonders für Leser, welche bereits Vorkenntnisse mir R oder im Bereich der Datenanalyse besitzen. Besonders gut gefiel mir das Kapitel über Modelle, in welchem Hadley Wickham darauf eingeht, wie man praxisnahe Modelle erstellt. In der Welt der Datenwissenschaft geht es darum, Modelle zu entwickeln, die nicht nur theoretisch korrekt sind, sondern auch in der realen Welt anwendbar und interpretierbar sind. Dieses Buch leistet einen hervorragenden Beitrag dazu, indem es den Lesern zeigt, wie sie Modelle erstellen, die echte Geschäftsprobleme lösen und nützliche Einblicke liefern.Das Kapitel zu Modellen beginnt mit einer fundierten Einführung in die theoretischen Grundlagen. Wickham erläutert die verschiedenen Arten von Modellen, von einfachen linearen Modellen bis hin zu komplexen maschinellen Lernmodellen. Dabei bleibt er stets verständlich und vermeidet unnötigen Fachjargon, was besonders für Leser mit wenig Erfahrung im Bereich der Modelle von Vorteil ist.Ein Höhepunkt dieses Buches ist die Betonung dessen, was ein gutes Modell ausmacht. Wickham stellt nicht nur Methoden vor, wie man Modelle erstellt, sondern erläutert auch die wichtigen Aspekte, die ein Modell zu einem nützlichen Werkzeug in der Datenanalyse machen. Er geht auf die Validierung von Modellen, das Überprüfen der Modellgenauigkeit und die Interpretation der Modellergebnisse ein. Diese praktische Herangehensweise ist äußerst wertvoll, da sie dem Leser dabei hilft, Modelle nicht nur zu erstellen, sondern auch kritisch zu bewerten und die Ergebnisse sinnvoll zu nutzen.Ein weiterer Pluspunkt dieses Buches ist die gute Strukturierung. Dieses ist so strukturiert, dass jedes Kapitel von einem wichtigen Schritt in der Daten-Analyse handelt. So beginnt es mit dem Aufbereiten von Daten, über das Programmieren, Modellieren und zuletzt Kommunizieren.Das Buch enthält auch viele praxisnahe Beispiele und Übungen, die den Lernprozess unterstützen und das Verständnis vertiefen. Die Beispiele basieren auf realen Datensätzen und realen Problemstellungen, was den Lesern hilft, das Gelernte in echten Szenarien anzuwenden.Zusammenfassend ist ""R für Data Science"" von Hadley Wickham ein ausgezeichnetes Buch, das einen tiefen Einblick in die Welt der Datenanalyse und Modelle in R bietet. Insbesondere das Kapitel zu Modellen glänzt mit praxisnahen Ansätzen, um gute Modelle zu erstellen und zu bewerten. Wickham's Schreibstil ist klar und verständlich, was das Lernen und die Umsetzung der Konzepte erleichtert. Dieses Buch ist ein Muss für jeden, der seine Datenanalysefähigkeiten in R auf ein höheres Niveau bringen möchte oder auch Forschung betreibt und seine Ergebnisse und Statistiken aufbereiten möchte.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175687164/reviews
711,"Superb! This books is one of the best learn-to-code books I’ve come across. The organization is well thought out and pedagogically sound. Many books on code are haphazardly assembled by someone who knows the subject matter but doesn’t consider how best to teach it. Hadley and crew clearly know how to teach. And they know how to write. The authors are the Hemingways of tech. The language is so silky smooth you never stumble over words. Rereading a sentence is simply never required. Stunning considering the technical nature of the content. The paragraphs are structured in such a way that you progress from the known to unknown. The style is light and conversational but never eccentric. They manage to keep the prose as light as a feather without any fluff. No wasted words here. Pure joy to read. The only time it felt like I might be in deep water is the first chapter on modeling. You can sense their excitement with the subject and they are off and running, pointing to great adventure like a kid in Disneyland while you’re struggling to keep up. The second chapter on modeling you get your sea legs and the sensation of drowning fades.The book doesn’t delve into statistical concept, but rather focuses on how to process, analyze and communicate data with the R programming language. Something R is specifically designed to do. If you’re thinking about learning a programming language to help with data analysis, stop, do not pass go, get this is the book. It includes a great set of exercises that prompt you to explore on your own. In short, get this book.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175687164/reviews
712,"I read this book for a graduate level statistics and R programming course. This book is supposed to be for beginners, which I am, yet expects the reader to have a base knowledge of R. The first chapter, for some reason, starts with how to create graphs instead of focusing on what R is, what it does and how it does it, and then discussing the strings, how to write them, and running through definitions. It just jumps right into the material.I would have liked for this book to have a step-by-step process guiding students through example activities and questions, like many other IT books do, but instead, it offers end of chapter review questions, which seem numerous and complex for a beginner, with each question expecting the reader to know precisely what to do. It was terribly confusing at times and there does not seem to be anyone to contact for clarification. Overall, I hated this book. However, it has potential to be great (hence the two star rating): remove the chapter review questions (all of them) and in their place add step-by-step activities throughout the chapters. Adding a dozen questions--each with five or six components--to the end of each chapter seems overwhelming to beginners, and that's not what an instructor wants to do to their students.

713,"The holy book of core data science with R by Wickham and Grolemund. No matter how experienced you are, you will find many ""tiny"" things to learn from this book. The book utilizes the ""tidyverse"" collection of packages with a coherent philosophy that sits behind them (tidyr for reshaping, dplyr for transformation, ggplot2 for visualisation, broom for linear models etc.) that dramatically speed up most of the common steps involved in an analysis. Although I was familiar with those packages, the book taught me purrr (for functional programming) and how to better use the packages together. This improved my functional programming skills tremendously.It also teaches you how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. Grolemund's Hands-On Programming with R is also a good companion for getting the most out of this book.The modelling part is a little rudimentary. Most of the examples are just fitting independent regression models, whereas it seems to me that a hierarchical model would be a better fit. Still these are small things and it would be silly to expect a single book to cover all of these areas.", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175687164/reviews
714,"I read this book to get reacquainted with R after having not used it for a while. This book serves as a great refresher, particularly if you’re interested in the “tidyverse” way of doing things. The book does lack introductions to foundational principles in R, and I’m not sure I would recommend it as a first introduction. There’s some interesting but brief coverage of plotting with ggplot2 and visualizing basic model outputs, but for more coverage, you will need to look elsewhere (the book often includes good references).The bulk of useful material is around munging data efficiently and in a way that is easy to understand (filtering, grouping, transforming, using various string and date manipulations). In my opinion, this is the most valuable change that the tidyverse suite brings—it’s much easier to write and read transformations written in this way than with base R indexing, etc. The libraries also provide a more opinionated and robust way to deal with messy data than the base R equivalents.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175687164/reviews
715,"4.4Wow, that was a very long 3 months of reading.I have been wanting to get into research for a while, and data science seemed? like an entry point? Honestly, I don't really know what I'm doing. Anyway, when I contacted a lab I was interested in, they took one look at my transcript and said, ""Do you have any of the skills needed for data science?"" And I was like, well, no. So they gave me this book, and I've been reading it ever since. (Putting a moderate time sink into learning skills has been a very productive theme of past summers.)I read the free online version of the book, supplemented with Arnold's amazing documentation of exercise solutions. Some bits were rough, because it's definitely hard to predict readers' prior knowledge, and some of the exercises could be improved/modernized, but overall I thought this was an extremely accessible and well-written book, relatively speaking. I highly recommend the online format, because the lack of page numbers makes time go by faster, and it doesn't feel like you're reading a ""real textbook"" at all. I feel so much more confident now than I did at the beginning of the summer as a life sciences major with about one college statistics course's knowledge of R.Also, on reflection a month later, I learned nothing about actual statistical techniques or modeling from this book. It is a fantastic resource for learning a certain approach to a very diverse language, but it will not replace your good old college statistics courses.Disclaimer: I have a moderate amount of background experience in general programming, which really helped throughout. (For example, the authors do not bother to explain what anonymous functions really are, although they spend a significant amount of time on for loops.) I don't know if this is the right resource to start coding entirely, unless you're solely planning on working in R.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175687164/reviews
716,"Well, I specifically bought the paper book on Amazon to get it through. I cannot say that I enjoyed it but it was usefull to improve my skills in R for data analysis. I used it together with courses on Datacamp. The book has a interactive web site made with Rmarkdown, the book itself is written with Rbookdown which I briefly discussed in the end. The book is in tidyverse way. So far it was the only useful book on R I could find for begginers. I was kind of intemediate in R already. I wanted to get more systematic in R skills. I still cannot write my own model, but I will be soon. Overall good guide to R using R-studio, while most of R is not learn reading the books, but by writing a code.

If you’re returning to R after some time away, this book is a brilliant refresher course.The one thing I will say, for those who are new to R, is that some elements of this can be a bit daunting when you first dive in. With R, it takes a while before you’re confident in your knowledge, and some of the things in this book require you to have a bit of faith in your capabilities.A very useful read, no matter your R knowledge.

So, simply, the book doesn't add anything to the course, which by the way, is a very bad-instructed and terrible course. It is not clear who the audience is, since the chapters are not in the same level. For instance, from very basic packages and tools, it jumps to very narrow topic of how to use multi-cores to speed up the calculations!I think if you want to benefit the most from the whole material provided in this course, simply install the swirl package, which is a complementary source for practicing what you are supposed to learn during the course, or read in the book.

742,"This ebook is a particularly useful guide for researchers of all kinds, with strong emphasis on how to systematically create reproducible reports. Reproducibility is a major key to effectively communicating our analyses and research findings to others so that anyone else can re-run or examine specific steps in our investigations to validate our results. And since nowadays most people have access to substantial computing power, free open-source statistical softwares, and cloud-based data infrastructures (e.g. Github), creating reproducible reports has never been easier. The author also provides a general introduction to R markdown using RStudio, which has become one of the most popular tools for creating reproducible reports.", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28712925/reviews
743,"This book is a guide to the practical application of statistics to data analysis in the physical sciences. It is primarily addressed at students and professionals who need to draw quantitative conclusions from experimental data. Although most of the examples are taken from particle physics, the material is presented in a sufficiently general way as to be useful to people from most branches of the physical sciences. The first part of the book describes the basic tools of data concepts of probability and random variables, Monte Carlo techniques, statistical tests, and methods of parameter estimation. The last three chapters then develop more advanced statistical ideas, focusing on interval estimation, characteristic functions, and correcting distributions for the effects of measurement errors (unfolding).", 4 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1988653.Statistical_Data_Analysis?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lolPVmy4Sz&rank=68/reviews
744,"My official endorsement (literally, it's on the publisher's website):Through apt use of analogies, hands-on exercises, and abundant opportunities to get coding, this book delivers on its promise to give a reader without a background in statistics or programming the tools necessary for understanding and conducting real-world statistical inference and data analysis. With an emphasis on learning new concepts first ""by hand,"" before turning to the code, it would make a particularly useful classroom companion. However, the ""learning checks"" provided throughout also make it a great guide for self-study. Students and teachers alike will benefit from this thoughtful introduction, as it addresses even the smallest of details that can trip beginners up, and keep them from getting to the more fruitful parts of data analysis.Also available free online: moderndive.com", 5 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51788540/reviews

The authors have introduced new libraries for performing statistical inference in a tidy way. The applications were too simple though. The comparison of theory vs simulation based inference methods was good, and a few more in-depth examples could have helped.

748,"Software applications of various kinds have long offered the ability for users to report upon the data that they have acquired and generated. More recently, and particularly with the advent of Big Data, users have begun to explore not only what is in their data sets, but also to ask why the results are as they are, how elements of the data sets are interrelated and whether historical data can be used to predict future values. Answering these types of questions has led to the emergence of the discipline of Data Science. While data science is somewhat vaguely defined, its practitioners typically hold an interdisciplinary skill set which may include elements of database analysis, programming, statistics and data visualisation.This book aims to introduce software developers to some of the different tools and techniques typically used in data science. In order to help make the content relevant to the target audience, the author attempts to draw parallels between data science and database development.The book is structured into twelve chapters. Strangely, given the book’s title, the discussion of statistical analysis only really starts at chapter five. The preceding chapters attempt to differentiate between the roles and responsibilities of database developers and those of data scientists. From chapter five onwards, the book introduces and discusses a variety of topics related to data science, including regression analysis, regularisation and boosting, as well as machine learning topics such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines. Where appropriate, examples are given in the R programming language, and the source code and data sets used within the book are available for download from the publisher’s website.Unfortunately, however, I can find little to recommend this book. The writing style is poor and the structure often meanders. In places the text does not read as being authoritative, with abrupt departures from the author’s loose conversational style into a more scholarly tone suggesting that the content is perhaps being drawn from elsewhere. Sentences often include unnecessary parenthetical comments, in one case six in a single sentence, which do little to aid readability. Parallels drawn with the author’s perceived experience of the ‘data or database developer’ are often tenuous. Indeed, the chapter titles themselves are somewhat misleading. It is hard to imagine, for example, what ‘database progression to database regression’ might actually refer to.Some examples which really need little explanation, such as the description of parallelism within artificial neural networks, are laboured and confusing. On other occasions, the text is simply wrong, for example, the output of a sigmoid function is incorrectly described as switching from zero to one based on some threshold. Frustratingly, some points of interest receive no explanation at all. For example, the outlier in a learning curve in the chapter on model assessment attracts no comment or explanation, the author preferring rather to explain how to export the graph as a PNG format file.The book’s references are obscure and poorly cited and some parts of the text, such as the section on variance, do little more than direct the reader to Wikipedia.The book is not helped by deficiencies in the editorial and production processes. There are spelling errors, repeated and nonsensical sentences and meaningless illustrations. Also, despite outward appearances, the first data set that is referred to in the text isn’t available in the accompanying download, the CSV file being merely a renamed copy of a text file containing the source code of the examples.There is certainly some useful information in this book, however for me the text felt like an early draft rather than a finished product. Rather than being helpful, I found the attempt to align concepts with those deemed to be familiar to the target readership often seemed awkward and, at times, patronising. There is no shortage of introductory books in the data science field and I would suggest that the time and effort required to read this book could more fruitfully be expended exploring other resources.Review by Patrick Hill BSc(Hons) MSc PhD CEng MBCS CITPOriginally published: http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/...", 2 out of 5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36963979/reviews

But that would be pure copy and paste, in terms of understanding it lacks the depth as well as the ease which was required.

759,"In any business, putting together a slide presentation can be very nerve-wracking. It's easy to do it wrong. This book presents ways to keep your audience from yawning or reaching for their cellphones.It starts with KISS (Keep it simple, stupid). Use only one chart, or one concept, per slide. Next, stay consistent throughout your presentation. Use the same font type, or font size (as much as possible). Use the same numerical scale on your charts. If one chart has a number xxx.x, use it on all other charts.If possible, use numbers in your charts that can be verified, and not guesses or projections. In these days of big data, there is no lack of data available. The hard part is to find the ""right"" data. That starts with knowing the right questions to ask. Sometimes, like in the legal field, words will be more important than numbers. Use bullet points - keep it simple.

790,"A good book, providing a broad overview of data science for business managers unfamiliar with the discipline. The author, UK based data science consultant Stylianos Kampakis, uses his experience working on various consulting projects to provide a how-to guide for those seeking to effectively use the skills of data scientists. Kampakis breaks down the many components of data science, from a detailed discussion of various analytic methods through to the intricacies of database management. The flow of the book roughly corresponds to the steps of the analytic process. Interspersed throughout the book are real world examples of data science projects, completed with varying degrees of success. These examples provide the needed context for the book’s explanations which, at times, can become very theoretical. Kampakis presents his overview with the mindset of a consultant; most of the work implores managers to give the data scientists the data and space needed to efficiently complete their work. A good book for anyone wanting to better understand the intricacies of data science. Highly recommended for managers embarking on a data science project.

792,"I find the current technology landscape both a blessing and a curse for companies that aim to be as data-driven as possible. It's a blessing, because now that we have access to very flexible and powerful cloud computing systems, we can spin virtually unlimited storage and computing power on demand, and then run state-of-the-art data analysis, machine learning and AI systems. But it's also a curse, because having such an easy access to so many practical, flexible technology solutions as well as powerful open source data systems, create the illusion that you can auto-magically overcome the challenges of creating more value based on company's data assets. In principle, no company would object to being more data-driven and quickly employing flexible, smart automation solutions, and enhance their business processes with machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. Unfortunately, many of those companies carry the risk of underestimating the importance of well-designed data management systems, processes, platforms and technologies, which, in turn, are inherently tied to data quality. Unless these topics are handled properly, it’s very challenging and costly to build reliable predictive data analytics, machine learning, and AI systems whose raw materials are high quality and well-managed data assets. One big concern is how to overcome such strategic challenges, in order to ensure that the ongoing data efforts will have the expected ROI.This book provides striking examples of not only best practices for complex enterprise big data management in service of creating value out of data assets, but also draws attention to pitfalls and risks involved. The book's focus on topics such as the importance of smart, automated and well-designed Data Catalogs, challenges in capturing the context, metadata, and data lineage surrounding Critical Data Elements include many lessons that easily apply to many enterprises big and small alike. Many companies also are negatively impacted by the dark data in their data landscape.I found the highlights below particularly important and relevant to my experience as a Data Officer in a very complex, international manufacturing environment:

   “The vision is often to eventually get rid of the data warehouse to save costs and improve performance, since big data platforms are much less expensive and much more scalable than relational databases. However, just offloading the data warehouse does not give the analysts access to the raw data. Because the rigorous architecture and governance applied to the data warehouse are still maintained, the organization cannot address all the challenges of the data warehouse, such as long and expensive change cycles, complex transformations, and manual coding as the basis for all reports. Finally, the analysts often do not like moving from a finely tuned data warehouse with lightning-fast queries to a much less predictable big data platform, where huge batch queries may run faster than in a data warehouse but more typical smaller queries may take minutes” 
  

   “Why is it so difficult to find data in the enterprise? Because the variety and complexity of the available data far exceeds human ability to remember it. Imagine a very small database, with only a hundred tables (some databases have thousands or even tens of thousands of tables, so this is truly a very small real-life database). Now imagine that each table has a hundred fields—a reasonable assumption for most databases, especially the analytical ones where data tends to be denormalized. That gives us 10,000 fields. How realistic is it for anyone to remember what 10,000 fields mean and which tables these fields are in, and then to keep track of them whenever using the data for something new? 
  

   Now imagine an enterprise that has several thousand (or several hundred thousand) databases, most an order of magnitude bigger than our hypothetical 10,000-field database. I once worked with a small bank that only had 5,000 employees, but managed to create 13,000 databases. I can only imagine how many a large bank with hundreds of thousands of employees might have. The reason I say “only imagine” is because none of the hundreds of large enterprises that I have worked with over my 30-year career were able to tell me how many databases they had—much less how many tables or fields. Hopefully, this gives you some idea of the challenge analysts face when looking for data.” 
  

   “Ideally, the analysts should be able to request access to the data they need. However, if they cannot find the data without having access to it, we have a catch-22.” 
  

   “In most enterprises the knowledge about where data is, which data sets to use for what, and what data means is locked in people’s heads—this is commonly referred to as ‘tribal knowledge‘.”


   “Without a Data Catalog, in order to find a data set to use for a specific problem, analysts have to ask around until they find someone—if they’re lucky, a subject matter expert (SME)—who can point them to the right data. SMEs can be difficult to find, though, so the analyst may instead run into someone who tells them about a data set that they used for a similar problem, and will then use that data set without really understanding what was done to it or where it came from.” 
  

   The solution is a more agile approach to access control that some enterprises are beginning to adopt. They create metadata catalogs that allow the analysts to find any data set without having access to it. Once the right data sets have been identified, the analysts request access to them and the data steward or data owner decides whether to grant access, for how long, and for which portions of the data. Once the access period expires, the access can be automatically revoked or an extension requested. 
  

   “It is much easier to document data sets when they are first created, because the information is fresh. Nevertheless, even at Google, while some popular data sets are well documented, there is still a vast amount of dark or undocumented data.” 
  

   “In traditional enterprises, the situation is much worse. There are millions of existing data sets (files and tables) that will never get documented by analysts unless they are used—but they will never be found and used unless they are documented. The only practical solution is to combine crowdsourcing with automation.” 
  

   “More modern data catalogs—especially catalogs with automated tagging—allow data quality specialists and data stewards to define and apply data quality rules for a specific tag.” 
  

   “For example, a numeric field with three-digit numbers ranging from 000 to 999 is very likely to be a credit card verification code if it is found next to a credit card number, but a field with exactly the same data is very unlikely to be a credit card verification code if found in a table where all the other tags refer to medical procedure properties.“ 
  

   “To solve the completeness problem, create a data catalog of all the data assets, so the analysts can find and request any data set that is available in the enterprise.”

813,"This is the first book that I've come across that is singularly focused on the rules, format, tips, and best practices for Kaggle ML/Data Science competitions. As such, this book is well-deserving of your dollars and attention.Before even delving into specific aspects of Machine Learning, the authors chose to spend a great deal of time (chapters 1-5) outlining the basics of Kaggle competitions from the history of the platform, to teams, datasets, notebooks, discussion forums, etiquette, and the different types of competitions available on the site. Complete beginners to Kaggle would get the most use of these chapters, it sure beats trying to figure all of this stuff out on your own.The remaining chapters start getting increasingly advanced in terms of subjects and techniques. I definitely appreciate the authors discussing the importance of the design of good model validation before delving deeper into hyper-parameter tuning, walk before you run!The later chapters really drill into more advanced techniques such as using hyperparameter studies and Bayesian optimization to extract the best combination of values for your specific model. Ensembling and stacking are presented as clearly as I've seen anywhere, along with the most helpful snippets of code to date on a ML book. This alone might be worth the price for some. Intermediate and advanced users will get the most of these chapters.A nice extra is the Q&A sections in each chapter with ""Kaggle Masters"", people who have either won competitions in the past or who regularly place very high in many competitions. These are done informally and provide a lot of great tips. Now, who is this book really for? If you are new to Machine Learning, I'd say that perhaps this would not be the best place to start. While the book is great for what it sets out to do (teach you to become a better competitor) it is not perfect. Some information that could be helpful to beginners is grossly glossed over, such as the explanation of specific hyperparams. It is very odd how they chose to handle this. Case-and-point: when going over XGBoost hyperparams such as ""n_estimators"", they describe it as ""usually an integer ranging from 10 to 5,000"". Compare this with Corey Wade's explanation(""Gradient Boosting with XGBoost and SciKit Learn"", also from Packt ), ""The number of trees in the ensemble/the number of trees trained on the residuals after each boosting round. Increasing might improve accuracy on larger datasets"". Which is more useful you think? You either explain it clearly for the benefit of all or just leave it out. Giving the domain and range is not a proper substitution. Obviously, the author's expect the reader to have had some exposure to algorithms and modeling as the pace of several sections move a little too quickly for the complete beginner. As such, I would say this is a perfect book for semi-intermediate to advanced users looking to extract the most out of their models.All in all, this is an excellent resource that will be sure to help countless current and aspiring data scientist in their journeys to become masters of their crafts.
