# Sentiment Analysis of Book Reviews
Being able to analyse feedbacks from book readers (main readers and forewards) is both interesting and enlightening. For this project the main idea stemmed from the need to pick one Data Science Book at a time for personal study, hence it was necessary to have an analysis of the available Data Science books to guide my choice.

## Project Overview📖

The goal of this project is to help individuals who need to make a decision on which Data Science books to read. It shows how to gather data on the available data science books, summarize and carry out sentiment analysis of reviews on the different classifications of Data Science books.

## Getting Started 🏁
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (as outlined in the _import line_ of each notebook/project_stage).
3. Run the project script or notebook to generate visualization and explore the data.

## Data

The data used in this project was scraped from [Goodreads](goodreads.com). This project set out to use [Amazon](amazon.com) but during the course of developing the code to scrape from the ```Amazon``` website, the host block API calls 'probably for commercial or security purpose'.

As at the time of publishing this project ```Goodreads``` allows scraping and has up to 10000 (about 20% scrapable items) book collections on Data science, while Amazon had up to 60,000 books on Data science. In spite of this however, the volume of data from ```Goodreads``` was sufficient to meet the needs of this project.

## Usage

Kindly follow these steps to use this project:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (as outlined in the _import line_ of each notebook/project_stage).
2. Endeavor to breakdown the code and tweak as you deem fit to generate your own data or you may go ahead to utilize the final data.
3. Run the project script or notebook using Python.
```NOTE```: Some packages may required heavy data downloads on your first import.
